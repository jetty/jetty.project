Contributing to Jetty
=====================
Thank you for your interest in this project!

Project description
--------------------
Jetty is a lightweight highly scalable java based web server and servlet engine.
Our goal is to support web protocols like HTTP, HTTP/2, and WebSocket in a high volume, low latency way that provides maximum performance while retaining the ease of use and compatibility with years of servlet development.
Jetty is a modern fully async web server that has a long history as a component oriented technology easily embedded into applications while still offering a solid traditional distribution for webapp deployment.
