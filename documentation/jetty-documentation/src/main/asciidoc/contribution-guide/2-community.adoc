== Participate in the Community

One of the best ways to start contribute and work with Eclipse Jetty is to get plugged into one of the existing communities.
In any one of these you will come across users of neophyte to expert experience and as time permits the developers of Jetty themselves.

[[cg-mailing-lists]]
=== Mailing Lists

Mailing lists are a wonderful way to interact with the community at large and for a certain class of issue have the best chances of achieving resolution.
There are a number of mailing lists available within the Jetty project and a good rule of thumb to choose between the developer and user lists is to ask yourself if your question is broadly interesting to the community, use the users list and if narrowly focused on Jetty internals or minutiae, then the dev list might be a better option.

=== Github: Issues and Features

While not necessarily a support channel for solving a specific user problem, the issue tracker for Eclipse Jetty is a great location for addressing issues or suggesting features you want to see (or ideally contribute) in Jetty.

When you file a Github Issue in the Eclipse Jetty project there are a number of *labels* available and we encourage to you use them appropriately.

* http://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project[Issues at Github].

We have additionally identified and labeled a number of issues that may be appropriate for users of different levels of expertise that might want to contribute to Jetty but not have a specific goal or issue in mind.

* https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22[Help Wanted]

Long story short, if you are interested in getting involved with the community, there are a number of options available and you are encouraged to participate at whatever level you like!
