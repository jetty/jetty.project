== Participate in the Documentation

Another wonderful way to help with Eclipse Jetty is to help contribute to our corpus of documentation.
We have made an effort to reduce the barriers to contributing to our documentation, and many contributors find our documentation as a low-key way to participate and learn the process.


[[cg-documentation-format]]
=== Source Control and Maven Build.

The Jetty documentation is a module within the overall Jetty project and is build as a part of the standard build process.
As such to checkout the documentation you can follow the link:#cg-community-source[same process] as checking out Jetty itself.

As a part of the main Jetty project the documentation is build through the link:#cg-contributing-build[same process] as Jetty.
However, it is a more independent module and can be worked with much simpler by building strictly the jetty-documentation module.

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....

$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project.git
$ cd jetty.project/jetty-documentation
$ mvn install

....

While maven is running you may see a lot of files being downloaded.
If you are not familiar with Maven you are seeing Maven set up the execution environment for generating the documentation.

The build is finished once you see a message akin to:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 9.272 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2018-04-09T13:06:10-05:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 74M/247M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
....

At this point you open your web browser and view the produced documentation (under the target/html directory)!

[TIP]
====
Pay close attention to the build output for lines like:

....
asciidoctor: WARNING: 9-jsp.adoc: line 0: id assigned to section already in use: ag-http2
....

This indicates that an ID is being reused and should be resolved or else deep linking will work correctly.
====

[[cg-documentation-render]]
=== The Render Chain Explained

The Jetty documentation is all written in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[asciidoc].
The maven build uses the asciidoctor-maven-plugin to process specific index.adoc[] files which act as the root structure for various guides (Administrative, Developer, QuickStart, etc).
The main pom.xml file also provides a maven profile which when activated can produce the guides in both pdf and epub formats.

[[cg-documentation-structure]]
=== Project Structure

It may be useful to understand the layout of the documentation before digging into the details.
The following table lists some helpful directories and their purpose.

.Documentation Layout
[cols="2"]
|===
| src/main/asciidoc | root of asciidoc layout
| src/main/asciidoc/*-guide | root structure for each individual guide
| target/html | post build, where the rendered html files will appear
| target/pdf | post build (-Palt-formats) pdf files
| target/epub | post build (-Palt-formats) epub files
|===

[[cg-documentation-guide]]
=== Guide Structure

Each guide starts with an *index.adoc* file which acts as the point of origin for the document structure.
It will declare useful metadata for the proper rendering of the overall guide and use the asciidoc *include* directive to pull in content for each chapter which are conveniently named by chapter number and name.

[[cg-documentation-conventions]]
=== Conventions

Below is list of conventions that should be followed when developing documentation within this framework.
These are not set in stone but you are encouraged to follow them when possible.

ventilated prose::
  Each sentence should generally be on its own line with a hard return at the end of the line.
  Asciidoc rendering does not treat this style as separate lines and will produce paragraphs correctly.
  The primary benefit is that you can easily see changes between versions of files, and it makes it trivial to quickly look through a pull request.
  Additional benefits are the ability to comment out a sentence mid paragraph or move sentences around within a paragraph.
  Enabling Soft Line Wrap in your favorite editor can make this a bit easier to stomach.

id's::
  Critically important for being able to generate url's that can be used in a persistent fashion.
  Without sane id's the chapters and sections will have generated id which are rooted in some obscure location based voodoo.
  A url using these 'e12c8673' type links will not be durable across generations of the documentation.
  These id's need to be used on chapters and sections two deep, and anywhere that you intend to cross link deeper.
  The id values go into a global namespace so they must be unique across the entire document or the last example will win and any cross links will go there.
  Links inside of a guides narrative structure should be prefixed with an acronym (contributor guide = cg-) while any links within the topics structure should be prefixed with t- and ideally the name of the topic it corresponds to.

link vs xref::
  The `link:` item should be generally used for linking around the document when you want to choose the text that will be rendered in the link itself.
  However if you are linking to a section and want to use the title itself as the link text, use the `xref:` tag without the hashmark in front of the link id.

cross guide linkage::
  To link to another guide it is best to use a property to address it.
  The following guide shortcuts are provided:
  * DISTGUIDE
  * EMBEDGUIDE
  * QUICKGUIDE
  * CONTRIBUIDE

....
This is a test to link to link:{DISTGUIDE}[Distribution Guide]

This is a test to deep link to link:{DISTGUIDE}#startup[Distribution Guide Deep Link]
....

This is a test to link to link:{DISTGUIDE}[Distribution Guide]

This is a test to deep link to link:{DISTGUIDE}#startup[Distribution Guide Deep Link]

images::
  Images are placed in the `/images*` directory of the guide they should appear in and then referenced with a `image:` tag.

....
image:small_powered_by.gif[image,width=340]
....

image:small_powered_by.gif[image,width=340]

version differences::
  In general differences in functionality within a release should go into nested sections and use titles like 'Prior to: ##' or 'In version: ##'.

license blocks::
  Each adoc file should contain the license block that exists in the index.adoc file and a copy has been added to the bottom of this page as well for reference.

==== Oddities

* If an included file ends with a list entry, it needs to have two empty lines at the end of the file in order for the section rendering to work correctly.
