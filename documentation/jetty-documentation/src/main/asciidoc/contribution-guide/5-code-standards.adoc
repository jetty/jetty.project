== Code Standards
This section outlines the various coding conventions and standards we use throughout the Jetty codebase.

=== Configuring your IDE

IntelliJ IDE::
An IntelliJ code style XML file is available in the source repo at
https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/blob/jetty-10.0.x/build-resources/jetty-codestyle-intellij.xml[`/build-resources/jetty-codestyle-intellij.xml`]
// TODO: The above link points to the jetty-10.0.x branch, but it doesn't look like there's a `build-resources` directory for jetty-12.0.x.
Follow https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html#import-export-schemes[IntelliJ's documentation] to import these settings into your IDE.

Eclipse IDE::
An Eclipse code style XML file is available in the source repo at

=== Java conventions

The following code sample shows some basic Java styles and conventions used throughout the Jetty codebase:

[source, java]
----
import some.exact.ClassName;      // GOOD
import some.wildcard.package.*;   // BAD!

package org.always.have.a.package;

/**
 * All classes should have a javadoc
 */
class MyClassName
{
    // Use 4 spaces to indent.
    // The code must format OK with default tab size of 8.

    private static final int ALL_CAPS_FOR_PUBLIC_CONSTANTS = 1;

    // Prefix fields with one underscore (_). This
    // convention is not mandatory, but the chosen style
    // should be used consistently within a single class.
    private Object _privateField;

    // Use getters and setters rather than public fields.
    // Braces always on new line.
    public void setPrivateField(Object privateField)
    {
        _privateField = privateField;
    }

    public Object getPrivateField()
    {
        return _privateField;
    }

    public void doSomething() throws SomeException
    {
        Object local_variable = _privateField;
        // Braces always on new line.
        if (local_variable == null)
        {
             // do Something
        }
    }
}
----

[[cg-code-standards-logging]]
=== Logging conventions

When deciding when and what to log, bear in mind a few things:

* Never use `LOG.debug()` without a preceding `if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())`.
* Avoid polluting the log with very long stack traces.
* Don't routinely produce logging events in response to data sent by a user.
* Only call one `LOG` method for a given event, to avoid generating confusingly interleaved log messages.
* Never call `LOG.warn()` right before throwing an exception, as this will likely result in double logging the exception.
* Avoid calling `LOG.debug()` right before throwing an exception, as this will make debug logs verbose while adding little information.
* When interacting with a request or other client-provided data that result in an exception, use `DEBUG`-level logging:
+
[source, java]
----
catch (Throwable t)
{
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
        LOG.debug("Something happened {} {} {}",x, y, z, t);
}
----
* When calling into application code that throws an exception, use `INFO`-level logging, and gate the log with `LOG.isDebugEnabled()` to reduce the size of logging stack traces:
+
[source, java]
----
catch (Throwable t)
{
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
        LOG.info("Something happened {} {} {}", x, y, z, t);
    else
        LOG.info("Something happened {} {} {} {}", x, y, z, t.toString());
}
----
* When exceptions happen in Jetty code, and if the exception is (1) not entirely unexpected, (2) can happen relatively frequently, or (3) can potentially have a very long stack trace, you can use `LOG.isDebugEnabled()` to cut down on the size of the logging of the stacktrace:
+
[source, java]
----
catch (Throwable t)
{
    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())
        LOG.warn("Something happened {} {} {}", x, y, z, t);
    else
        LOG.warn("Something happened {} {} {} {}", x, y, z, t.toString());
}
----

[TIP]
====
By default, Jetty's logger outputs a full stacktrace whether you call it like `LOG.warn("Something happened", t)` or `LOG.warn("Something happened {}", t)`.

If you only want the log message but not the stack trace, you need to do call `.toString()` on the caught exception, e.g., `LOG.warn("Something happened {}", t.toString())`.
