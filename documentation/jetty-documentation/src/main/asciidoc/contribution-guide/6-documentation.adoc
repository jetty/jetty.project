[[cg-documentation]]
== Writing Documentation

Another great way to contribute to Jetty is to help us write and maintain our documentation.

[[cg-documentation-guides]]
=== Documentation guides
Jetty's documentation is grouped into three guides, each written for a different target audience.

Operations Guide::
Targets sysops, devops, and developers who want to run Jetty as a standalone web server.

Programming Guide::
Targets developers who want to use the Jetty libraries in their applications.

Contribution Guide::
Targets developers and writers who want to make contributions to the Jetty project.

[[cg-documentation-toolchain]]
=== The documentation toolchain
Jetty follows a https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/["docs as code"] philosophy, meaning *we use the same tools to write and build our code and docs*.
As such, the docs are maintained directly within the Jetty codebase at https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/tree/jetty-12.0.x/documentation/jetty-documentation/src/main/asciidoc[`documentation/jetty-documentation/src/main/asciidoc/`].

[[cg-documentation-asciidoc]]
==== AsciiDoc
Our docs are written in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc], a markup language for writing technical content.
AsciiDoc supports many advanced features, such as robust linking across different documentation sets, while remaining human-readable.

Although Jetty takes advantage of many of these features, you don't need to be an AsciiDoc expert to contribute to our documentation.
If you _are_ interested in learning the ins and outs of AsciiDoc, the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[official language documentation] is a good place to start.

[[cg-documentation-asciidoctor]]
==== Maven and Asciidoctor
In addition to using Maven to xref:cg-build[build the Jetty codebase], we use it to build our docs.
During a build, Maven converts AsciiDoc-formatted docs into the HTML pages that you are reading right now.

https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] is the tool that actually performs this compilation step.
Maven integrates with Asciidoctor via the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/maven-tools/latest/[`asciidoctor-maven-plugin`].

[[cg-documentation-build]]
=== Building the docs

Since Jetty's docs are maintained in `git` alongside the rest of the Jetty codebase, you'll need to xref:cg-source[check out a local copy] of the code to contribute to the docs.

The docs are maintained as a separate module within Jetty, which means you can build the docs separately from the rest of the project.
To do so, run `mvn clean install` from the `documentation/jetty-documentation` subdirectory.

[source, shell]
----
$ cd jetty.project/documentation
$ mvn install
<...snip...>
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

[NOTE]
====
You'll see a lot of files getting downloaded during the build process.
This is Maven setting up the execution environment, which it uses to generate the docs.
====

When the build completes, you can view the generated docs in your preferred web browser by opening file:///path/to/jetty.project/documentation/jetty-documentation/target/html/index.html on your local filesystem.

[[cg-documentation-build-structure]]
==== Documentation project structure

The documentation root is https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/tree/jetty-10.0.x/documentation/jetty-documentation[`documentation/jetty-documentation/`].
Within this root directory are some files and subdirectories of note:

https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/tree/jetty-10.0.x/documentation/jetty-documentation/src/main/asciidoc[`src/main/asciidoc`]::
The primary root for all documentation content.

https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/tree/jetty-10.0.x/documentation/jetty-documentation/src/main/asciidoc/config.adoc[`src/main/asciidoc/config.adoc`]::
This file contains metadata and global variables shared across all the xref:cg-documentation-guides[documentation guides].
This configuration is used by Asciidoctor to correctly render the final docs.

`src/main/asciidoc/*-guide`::
Secondary root directories for each individual xref:cg-documentation-guides[documentation guide].

`src/main/asciidoc/*-guide/index.adoc`::
Asciidoctor's "point of entry" for each guide.
Content is pulled into the guide via the `include::` directives in these index files.
Also, guide-specific metadata and variables that wouldn't belong in the root `config.adoc` can also be defined here.

`target/<format>`::
The final build destination for any docs generated by Maven.
By default, docs are generated into `target/html`, but other formats (e.g., `pdf` and `epub`) are available.
This directory is not checked into `git`.

[[cg-documentation-style]]
=== Style guide

The following conventions are not set in stone, but you are encouraged to follow them where possible.
Stylistically consistency helps keep the docs easy to both understand and maintain.

[[cg-documentation-style-prose]]
==== Ventilated prose

In markup, *each sentence should be on its own line with a hard return at the end of the line*.
This practice is known variously as https://writetheasciidocs.netlify.app/ventilated-prose[ventilated prose] or https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/[semantic linefeeds].

This practice makes for more readable file diffs, and also makes it easier to comment out individual lines or to move sentences around.

[TIP]
====
AsciiDoc treats a single line breaks just like a space, so it will render ventilated prose naturally.
====

[[cg-documentation-versions]]
==== Documenting versions

[[cg-documentation-versions-multiple]]
===== Documenting multiple versions at once

Jetty 12 features many parallel modules with similar names and functionality, but which target different versions of Jakarta EE.
For instance, the `ee8-deploy`, `ee9-deploy`, and `ee10-deploy` modules all behave similarly, except they target Jakarta EE8, EE9, and EE10, respectively.

Whenever possible, *try to consolidate these types of parallel references*.
For instance, you can quickly refer to all three of the aforementioned modules as a group by writing `{ee-all}-deploy` or `eeN-deploy`.

Another approach is to write your docs targeting one specific module, and tell the reader what substitution(s) they would need to make to target a different module.

[NOTE]
====
When targeting a specific version in your docs for demonstration purposes, you should prefer to use the most recent version number.
For the example above, this would mean targeting `{ee-current}-deploy`.
====

Consolidating parallel references saves readers from having to sift through repetitive material, and helps us avoid maintaining multiple versions of nearly identical docs.

[[cg-documentation-versions-multiple-example]]
===== Dealing with multiple versions in code examples

Instead of referencing multiple versions in your code and command-line examples, it's generally better to target one specific version, typically the latest (currently `{ee-current}`):

[source,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules={ee-current}-deploy
----

This will work when copy-pasted into the command line.

[NOTE]
====
You may want to remind the reader to change the `10` in the command to their preferred target version -- although doing so isn't strictly necessary for a simple example like above.
====

[[cg-documentation-license]]
=== License blocks
Each `.adoc` file should contain the license block that exists in the `index.adoc` file.
For reference, here is a standard license header:

[[cg-documentation-asciidoc-conventions]]
=== AsciiDoc conventions

[[cg-documentation-asciidoc-conventions-ids]]
==== Custom IDs
We rely heavily on https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/custom-ids/[custom IDs] for generating stable documentation URLs and linking within docs.

At minimum, every chapter and top-level section should have its own custom ID; however, best practice is to give each subsection its own custom ID, too.

[NOTE]
====
Custom IDs share a single global namespace, which means they must be unique across all documentation guides.
To help deal with this constraint, we used different ID prefixes in each guide:

* Operations Guide: `og-`
* Programming Guide: `pg-`
* Contribution Guide: `cg-`
====

[[cg-documentation-asciidoc-conventions-images]]
==== Images
Images should live in the `images/` directory of the guide they appear in.
Use the `image::` directive to include an image, like so:

----
image::small_powered_by.gif[image,width=145]
----

image::small_powered_by.gif[image,width=145]

[[cg-documentation-asciidoc-conventions-admonitions]]
==== Admonitions

Admonitions (or "callout blocks") are useful for flagging information that doesn't belong in the natural flow of text.
Asciidoc supports five levels of admonition:

* `[NOTE]`
* `[IMPORTANT]`
* `[TIP]`
* `[CAUTION]`
* `[WARNING]`

Each admonition's visual appearance and typical usage situation are as follows:

[NOTE]
====
A note about the previous case to be aware of.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Important notes are marked with an icon.
====

[TIP]
====
Tips that make your life easier.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Places where you have to be careful what you are doing.
====

[WARNING]
====
Where extreme care has to be taken.
Data corruption or other nasty things may occur if these warnings are ignored.
====
