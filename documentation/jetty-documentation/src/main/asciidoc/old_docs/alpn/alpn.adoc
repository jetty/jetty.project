=== Introducing ALPN

Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a TLS extension that allows client and server to negotiate the application protocol that they will use to communicate within the encryption provided by TLS.

Any protocol can be negotiated by ALPN within a TLS connection; the protocols that are most commonly negotiated are HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1.

Browsers only support HTTP/2 over TLS by negotiating the HTTP/2 protocol via ALPN.
You need to configure the server to support TLS and ALPN if you want browsers to use
the HTTP/2 protocol, otherwise they will default to HTTP/1.1.

In the Jetty project, ALPN is _used_ in two artifacts: `jetty-alpn-client` and `jetty-alpn-server`, respectively for the client and for the server.

When using Jetty as a standalone server via the Jetty distribution, the `jetty-alpn-server` artifact is automatically included in the server classpath by the Jetty module system.

When using Jetty embedded, the `jetty-alpn-client` and `jetty-alpn-server` artifacts must be included in the classpath, respectively for client and server use cases.

The ALPN implementation is _provided_ to these two artifacts with the following three options:

* For JDK 8 or later, a provider based on the link:#conscrypt[Conscrypt security provider]
** Works with JDK 8 or later and provides improved performance
** Binds to the OpenSSL native library shipped by Conscrypt and is therefore only available on the platforms supported by Conscrypt
* For JDK 9 or later, a provider based on the ALPN APIs present in the JDK
** Works with JDK 9 or later, pure Java implementation
** Lower performance than Conscrypt

The first, although hosted under the umbrella of the Jetty project, is independent of Jetty (the Servlet Container); you can use it in any other Java network server.

Each provider above provides an ALPN _service_ implementation; Jetty uses the `ServiceLoader` mechanism to load these service implementations.
At least one valid provider must be present in the server classpath.
For example, using JDK 8 with the JDK 9 ALPN provider is an _invalid_ combination.
The absence of valid implementations is an error at startup (see also the link:#alpn-troubleshooting[troubleshooting section]).

There may be multiple ALPN service providers in the server classpath.
When a new connection is created, an `SSLEngine` instance is associated to it; each `SSLEngine` is passed all service implementations, until one accepts it.

It is therefore possible to have multiple providers active at the same time, for example the JDK 9 provider and the Conscrypt provider, and at runtime the correct one will be chosen by the Jetty runtime.

[[alpn-conscrypt]]
==== ALPN and Conscrypt

When using JDK 8 or later, you can use the https://conscrypt.org/[Conscrypt] security provider to provide the ALPN service implementation.

Conscrypt binds natively to BoringSSL (a fork of OpenSSL by Google), so ALPN will be supported via the support provided by BoringSSL (bundled together with Conscrypt).

When using Jetty as a standalone server via the Jetty distribution, ALPN is enabled by enabling the `conscrypt` module.

When using Jetty embedded, ALPN is enabled by the `jetty-alpn-conscrypt-client` and `jetty-alpn-conscrypt-server` artifacts, respectively for client usage and server usage.
In addition, you also need the Conscrypt artifacts, typically the `org.conscrypt:conscrypt-openjdk-uber` artifact.
All these artifacts must be added to the classpath.

[[alpn-jdk9]]
==== ALPN and JDK 9

When using JDK 9 or later and Jetty as a standalone server via the Jetty distribution, ALPN support is automatically enabled when the `http2` module is enabled.
This enables transitively the `alpn-9` module which puts the `jetty-alpn-java-server` artifact in the server classpath, providing the ALPN JDK 9 service implementation.

When using JDK 9 or later and Jetty embedded, the ALPN service implementation is provided by the `jetty-alpn-java-client` and `jetty-alpn-java-server` artifacts, respectively for client usage and server usage, and must be added to the classpath.

[[alpn-osgi]]
===== Starting in OSGi

To use ALPN in an OSGi environment, in addition to what described above, you will also need to deploy the `jetty-osgi-alpn` jar.
This jar contains a `Fragment-Host` directive that ensures the ALPN classes will be available from the system bundle.

You can download the https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jetty/osgi/jetty-osgi-alpn/[jetty-osgi-alpn jar] from Maven Central.

____
[NOTE]
OSGi *requires* a `ServiceLoader` implementation for Jetty to function properly.
OSGi leverages http://aries.apache.org/modules/spi-fly.html[Apache Aries SPI Fly] for this functionality.
You can read more about OSGi and `ServiceLoader` http://blog.osgi.org/2013/02/javautilserviceloader-in-osgi.html[here.]

[[alpn-troubleshooting]]
==== ALPN Troubleshooting

When starting the Jetty server, especially when using Jetty embedded, it may be possible that you see an error similar to this:

[source, plain, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
IllegalStateException: no ALPN processor
----

The error means that you don't have the ALPN dependencies setup correctly in your classpath.

For example, you do not have the `jetty-alpn-java-server` artifact in the classpath.
