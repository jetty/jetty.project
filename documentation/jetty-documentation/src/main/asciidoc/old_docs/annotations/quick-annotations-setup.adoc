=== Quick Setup

==== Jetty Distribution

If you are using the jetty distribution, then annotations are enabled by default.
The annotations link:#startup-modules[module] and its transitive dependencies are responsible for making annotation processing available.

Note that annotations that relate to link:#jndi[JNDI], such as @Resource and @Resources are enabled via the JNDI module, which is a transitive dependency on the annotations module.

==== Jetty Maven Plugin

Annotations and JNDI are pre-enabled for the Maven plugin.

==== Embedding

To use annotations in an embedded scenario, you will need to include the `jetty-annotations` jar and all its dependencies onto your classpath.
You will also need to include the `org.eclipse.jetty.annotations.AnnotationConfiguration` class into the list of link:#webapp-configurations[Configuration classes] applied to the `org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebAppContext` class representing your webapp.

Below is an example application that sets up the standard `test-spec.war` webapp from the distribution in embedded fashion.
It can also be found in the Jetty GitHub repository on the examples/embedded page as link:{GITBROWSEURL}/examples/embedded/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/embedded[`ServerWithAnnotations.java`.]
Note that the `test-spec.war` uses not only annotations, but also link:#jndi[JNDI], so this example also enables their processing (via the link:#jndi-configuration-classes[org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration], link:#jndi-configuration-classes[org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.PlusConfiguration] and their related jars).
