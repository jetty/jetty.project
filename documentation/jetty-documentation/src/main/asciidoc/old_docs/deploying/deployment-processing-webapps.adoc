[[configuring-webapps]]
=== Deployment Processing of WebAppContexts

Web applications require a certain amount of processing before they can go into service: they may need to be unpacked, a special classloader created for their jar files, `web.xml` and `web-fragment.xml` descriptors processed, and classes scanned for annotations amongst other things.
As web applications have become more complex, Jetty has added ways to assist with customization by either broadening or lessening the amount of processing that is done at deployment time.
This section will examine this processing and it can be tailored to fit individual needs.

If instead you're looking for information on how to configure a specific `WebAppContext` - such as its context path, whether it should be unpacked or not - then you can find that in the section entitled link:#configuring-specific-webapp-deployment[Configuring a Specific WebApp Deployment].

[[webapp-configurations]]
==== Configuration Classes

As a webapp is being deployed, a series of link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/Configuration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.Configuration] classes are applied to it, each one performing a specific function.
The ordering of these Configurations is significant as subsequent Configurations tend to build on information extracted or setup in foregoing Configurations.
These are the default list, in order, of Configurations that are applied to each link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebAppContex]t:

.Default Configuration classes
[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebInfConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebInfConfiguration]
|Extracts war, orders jars and defines classpath

|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebXmlConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebXmlConfiguration]
|Processes a WEB-INF/web.xml file

|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/MetaInfConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.MetaInfConfiguration]
|Looks in container and webapp jars for META-INF/resources and
META-INF/web-fragment.xml

|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/FragmentConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.FragmentConfiguration]
|Processes all discovered META-INF/web-fragment.xml files

|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/JettyWebXmlConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.JettyWebXmlConfiguration]
|Processes a WEB-INF/jetty-web.xml file
|=======================================================================

===== Anatomy of a Configuration Class

A Configuration class is called 5 times in different phases of the link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html[`WebAppContext's`] lifecycle:

preConfigure::
  As the `WebAppContext` is starting up this phase is executed.
  The `Configuration` should discover any of the resources it will need during the subsequent phases.
configure::
  This phase is where the work of the class is done, usually using the resources discovered during the `preConfigure` phase.
postConfigure::
  This phase allows the `Configuration` to clear down any resources that may have been created during the previous 2 phases that are not needed for the lifetime of the `WebAppContext`.
deconfigure::
  This phase occurs whenever a `WebAppContext` is being stopped and allows the Configuration to undo any resources/metadata that it created.
  A `WebAppContext` should be able to be cleanly start/stopped multiple times without resources being held.
destroy::
  This phase is called when a `WebAppContext` is actually removed from service.
  For example, the war file associated with it is deleted from the $JETTY_HOME/webapps directory.

Each phase is called on each `Configuration` class in the order in which the `Configuration` class is listed.
Using the default `Configuration` classes as an example, `preConfigure()` will be called on `WebInfConfiguration`, `WebXmlConfiguration`, `MetaInfConfiguration`, `FragmentConfiguration` and then `JettyWebXmlConfiguration`.
The cycle begins again for the `configure()` phase and again for the `postConfigure()` phases.
The cycle is repeated _in reverse order_ for the `deconfigure()` and eventually the `destroy()` phases.

===== Extending Container Support by Creating Extra Configurations

As shown, there is a default set of Configurations that support basic deployment of a webapp.
JavaEE features such as JNDI and advanced servlet spec features such as annotations have not been mentioned.
Jetty's philosophy is to allow the user to tailor the container exactly to their needs.
If these features are not needed, then Jetty does not pay the price for them - an important consideration because features such as annotations require extensive and time-consuming scanning of `WEB-INF/lib` jars.
As modern webapps may have scores of these jars, it can be a source of significant deployment delay.
We will see in the section link:#webapp-context-attributes[Other Configuration] another helpful webapp facility that Jetty provides for cutting down the time spent analyzing jars.

Jetty makes use of the flexibility of Configurations to make JNDI and annotation support pluggable.

Firstly, lets look at how Configurations help enable JNDI.

[[jndi-configuration-classes]]
====== Example: JNDI Configurations

JNDI lookups within web applications require the container to hookup resources defined in the container's environment to that of the web application.
To achieve that, we use 2 extra Configurations:

.JNDI Configuration classes
[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/plus/webapp/EnvConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration]
|Creates `java:comp/env` for the webapp, applies a `WEB-INF/jetty-env.xml` file

|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/plus/webapp/PlusConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.PlusConfiguration]
|Processes JNDI related aspects of `WEB-INF/web.xml` and hooks up naming entries
|=======================================================================

These configurations must be added in _exactly_ the order shown above and should be inserted _immediately before_ the link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/JettyWebXmlConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.JettyWebXmlConfiguration] class in the list of configurations.
To fully support JNDI additional configuration is required, full details of which can be found link:#jndi[here].

====== Example: Annotation Configurations

We need just one extra Configuration class to help provide servlet annotation scanning:

.Annotation Configuration classes
[cols=",",]
|=======================================================================
|link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/annotations.AnnotationConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.annotations.AnnotationConfiguration]
|Scan container and web app jars looking for @WebServlet, @WebFilter,
@WebListener etc
|=======================================================================

The above configuration class must be _inserted immediately before_ the link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/JettyWebXmlConfiguration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.JettyWebXmlConfiguration] class in the list of configurations.
To fully support annotations additional configuration is require, details of which can be found link:#webapp-context-attributes[below.]

===== How to Set the List of Configurations

You have a number of options for how to make Jetty use a different list of Configurations.

====== Setting the list directly on the WebAppContext

If you have only one webapp that you wish to affect, this may be the easiest option.
You will, however, either need to have a context xml file that represents your web app, or you need to call the equivalent in code.
Let's see an example of how we would add in the Configurations for both JNDI _and_ annotations:

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://jetty.org/configure_9_3.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebAppContext">

  <Set name="war"><SystemProperty name="jetty.base" default="."/>/webapps/my-cool-webapp</Set>

  <Set name="configurationClasses">
    <Array type="java.lang.String">
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebInfConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebXmlConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.MetaInfConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.FragmentConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.PlusConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.annotations.AnnotationConfiguration</Item>
      <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.JettyWebXmlConfiguration</Item>
    </Array>
  </Set>

</Configure>
----

Of course, you can also use this method to reduce the Configurations applied to a specific `WebAppContext`.

====== Setting the list for all webapps via the Deployer

If you use the link:#deployment-architecture[deployer], you can set up the list of Configuration classes on the link:#default-web-app-provider[WebAppProvider].
They will then be applied to each `WebAppContext` deployed by the deployer:

[source,xml,subs="{sub-order}"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://jetty.org/configure_9_3.dtd">

<Configure id="Server" class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server">

  <Call name="addBean">
    <Arg>
      <New id="DeploymentManager" class="org.eclipse.jetty.deploy.DeploymentManager">
        <Set name="contexts">
          <Ref refid="Contexts" />
        </Set>
        <Call id="webappprovider" name="addAppProvider">
          <Arg>
            <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.ee10.deployer.WebAppProvider">
              <Set name="monitoredDirName"><Property name="jetty.base" default="." />/webapps</Set>
              <Set name="configurationClasses">
                <Array type="java.lang.String">
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebInfConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebXmlConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.MetaInfConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.FragmentConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.PlusConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.annotations.AnnotationConfiguration</Item>
                  <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.JettyWebXmlConfiguration</Item>
                </Array>
              </Set>
            </New>
          </Arg>
        </Call>
      </New>
    </Arg>
  </Call>
</Configure>
----

====== Adding or inserting to an existing list

Instead of having to enumerate the list in its entirety, you can simply nominate classes that you want to add, and indicate whereabouts in the list you want them inserted.
Let's look at an example of using this method to add in Configuration support for JNDI - as usual you can either do this in an xml file, or via equivalent code.
This example uses an xml file, in fact it is the `$JETTY_HOME/etc/jetty-plus.xml` file from the Jetty distribution:

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://jetty.org/configure_9_3.dtd">

<Configure id="Server" class="org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server">

  <!-- =========================================================== -->
  <!-- Add plus Configuring classes to all webapps for this Server -->
  <!-- =========================================================== -->
  <Call class="org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.Configuration$ClassList" name="setServerDefault">
    <Arg><Ref refid="Server" /></Arg>
    <Call name="addAfter">
      <Arg name="afterClass">org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.FragmentConfiguration</Arg>
      <Arg>
        <Array type="String">
          <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration</Item>
          <Item>org.eclipse.jetty.plus.webapp.PlusConfiguration</Item>
        </Array>
      </Arg>
    </Call>
  </Call>

</Configure>
----

The link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/Configuration.html[org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.Configuration.ClassList] class provides these methods for insertion:

addAfter::
  Inserts the supplied list of `Configuration` class names after the given Configuration class name.
addBefore::
  Inserts the supplied list of `Configuration` class names before the given Configuration class name.

[[webapp-context-attributes]]
==== Other Configuration

[[container-include-jar-pattern]]
===== org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.ContainerIncludeJarPattern

This is a link:#context_attributes[context attribute] that can be set on link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/webapp/WebAppContext.html[an org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebAppContext] to control which parts of the _container's_ classpath should be processed for things like annotations, `META-INF/resources`, `META-INF/web-fragment.xml` and `tlds` inside `META-INF`.

Normally, nothing from the container classpath will be included for processing.
However, sometimes you will need to include some.
For example, you may have some libraries that are shared amongst your webapps and thus you have put them into a `$JETTY_HOME/lib` directory.
The libraries contain annotations and therefore must be scanned.

The value of this attribute is a regexp that defines which _jars_ and _class directories_ from the container's classpath should be examined.

Here's an example from a context xml file (although as always, you could have accomplished the same in code), which would match any jar whose name starts with "foo-" or "bar-", or a directory named "classes":

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://jetty.org/configure_9_3.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebAppContext">

    <Call name="setAttribute">
      <Arg>org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.ContainerIncludeJarPattern</Arg>
      <Arg>.*/foo-[^/]*\.jar$|.*/bar-[^/]*\.jar$|.*/classes/.*</Arg>
    </Call>

</Configure>
----

Note that the order of the patterns defines the ordering of the scanning of the jars or class directories.

[[web-inf-include-jar-pattern]]
===== org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.WebInfIncludeJarPattern

Similarly to the previous link:#context_attributes[context attribute], this attribute controls which jars are processed for things like annotations, `META-INF/resources`, `META-INF/web-fragment.xml` and `tlds` in `META-INF`.
However, this attribute controls which jars from the _webapp's_ classpath (usually `WEB-INF/lib`) are processed.
This can be particularly useful when you have dozens of jars in `WEB-INF/lib`, but you know that only a few need to be scanned.

Here's an example in a xml file of a pattern that matches any jar that starts with `spring-`:

[source, xml, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://jetty.org/configure_9_3.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.WebAppContext">

    <Call name="setAttribute">
      <Arg>org.eclipse.jetty.server.webapp.WebInfIncludeJarPattern</Arg>
      <Arg>.*/spring-[^/]*\.jar$</Arg>
    </Call>

</Configure>
----

Note that the order of the patterns defines the ordering of the scanning of jar files.
