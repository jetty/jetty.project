[[embedded-minimal-servlet]]
==== Minimal Servlet

This example shows the bare minimum required for deploying a servlet into Jetty.
Note that this is strictly a servlet, not a servlet in the context of a web application, that example comes later.
This is purely just a servlet deployed and mounted on a context and able to process requests.
This example is excellent for situations where you have a simple servlet that you need to unit test, just mount it on a context and issue requests using your favorite http client library (like our Jetty client found in xref:client-http[]).

===== Walkthrough

Start things up! By using the `server.join()` the server thread will join with the current thread.
See link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html#join()[`Thread.join()`] for more details.

It is really simple to create useful servlets for testing behaviors. Sometimes you need a http server to run a unit test against that will return test content and wiring up a servlet like this makes it trivial.

After you have started things up you should be able to navigate to http://localhost:8080/ and you are good to go.

===== Maven Coordinates

To use this example in your project you will need the following Maven dependencies declared.
