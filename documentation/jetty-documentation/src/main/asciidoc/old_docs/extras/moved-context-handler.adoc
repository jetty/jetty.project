=== Moved Context Handler

[[moved-context-handler-metadata]]

* Classname: `org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.MovedContextHandler`
* Maven Artifact: org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server
* Javadoc: {JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/MovedContextHandler.html

[[moved-context-handler-usage]]
==== Usage

You can use the `MovedContextHandler` to relocate or redirect a context that has changed context path and/or virtual hosts.

You can configure it to _permanently_ redirect the old URL to the new URL, in which case Jetty sends a Http Status code of 301 to the browser with the new URL.
Alternatively, you can make it non-permanent, in which case Jetty sends a 302 Http Status code along with the new URL.

In addition, as with any other context, you can configure a list of virtual hosts, meaning that this context responds only to requests to one of the listed host names.

Suppose you have a context deployed at `/foo`, but that now you want to deploy at the root context `/` instead.

* First you reconfigure and redeploy the context on Jetty.
* Next you need a way to redirect all the browsers who have bookmarked `/foo` to the new path.
You create a new xref:configuring-contexts[context xml] file in `{$jetty/.base}/webapps` and configure the `MovedContextHandler` to do the redirection from `/foo` to `/`.

Below is an example.
This is a permanent redirection, which also preserves `pathinfo` and query strings on the redirect:
