=== What Version Do I Use?

Jetty 10 and 11 are the most recent versions of Jetty and has a great many improvements over previous versions.
This documentation which focuses on Jetty 10.
While many people continue to use older versions of Jetty, we generally recommend using Jetty 10 or 11 (more on the differences later) as they represent the version of Jetty that we will actively maintain and improve over the next few years.

_____
[IMPORTANT]
It is important that only stable releases are used in production environments.
Versions that have been deprecated or are released as Milestones (M) or Release Candidates (RC) are not suitable for production as they may contain security flaws or incomplete/non-functioning feature sets.
