=== Upgrading from Jetty 9.3.x to Jetty 9.4.0

The purpose of this guide is to assist users migrating from Jetty 9.3.x to 9.4.0.
It is not comprehensive, but covers many of the major changes included in the release that may prove as problem areas for users.

==== The jetty.sh Script

The file `jetty.sh`, typically used to start Jetty as a service in Linux/Unix machines underwent only small changes, such as the addition of https://wiki.debian.org/LSBInitScripts[LSB tags].

You can safely replace the `jetty.sh` file packaged with Jetty 9.3 with the version found in Jetty 9.4.

==== Removed Classes

`ConcurrentArrayQueue` was removed from use in Jetty 9.3 and the class has been removed entirely as part of Jetty 9.4.

==== Module Changes in Jetty 9.4

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Jetty 9.3 Module | Jetty 9.4 Module
| `logging`    | `console-capture`
| `infinispan` | `session-store-infinispan-embedded` or `session-store-infinispan-remote`
| `jdbc-sessions` | `session-store-jdbc`
| `gcloud-memcached-sessions`, `gcloud-session-idmgr` and `gcloud-sessions` | `session-store-gcloud` and `session-store-cache`
| `nosql` | `session-store-mongo`
|===

===== Logging Modules

The module `logging` is no longer available in Jetty 9.4.

The logging module structure present in Jetty 9.3 has been replaced with a more fine-grained structure in Jetty 9.4, so that you have now more choices available that are also easier to configure.

The migration path is different depending on whether you have completely customized this module or not.

If you have a Jetty 9.3 installation, and you have both `$jetty.base/modules/logging.mod` and `$jetty.base/etc/jetty-logging.xml`, then this module is local to your `$jetty.base` setup and will be used by Jetty 9.4 as before.
No changes are required for your implementation.

If either `$jetty.base/modules/logging.mod` or `$jetty.base/etc/jetty-logging.xml` are missing, then you were relying on those present in `$jetty.home`, which were present in Jetty 9.3, but are no longer available in Jetty 9.4.

The Jetty 9.3 `logging` module has been renamed to `console-capture` in Jetty 9.4.
You need to open your Jetty 9.3 `start.ini` and replace the references to the `logging` modules with `console-capture`.

For example, in an existing Jetty 9.3 `start.ini` file the module declaration for logging would look like this:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
--module=logging
jetty.logging.retainDays=7
----

In 9.4, it should be replaced by:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
--module=console-capture
jetty.console-capture.retainDays=7
----

The properties that may be present in your Jetty 9.3's `start.ini`, such as `jetty.logging.retainDays` will still be working in Jetty 9.4, but a warning will be printed at Jetty 9.4 startup, saying to replace them with correspondent `jetty.console-capture.*` properties such as `jetty.console-capture.retainDays`.

==== Session Management

Session management received a significant overhaul in Jetty 9.4.
Session functionality has been refactored to promote code-reuse, easier configuration and easier customization.
Whereas previously users needed to edit xml configuration files, in Jetty 9.4 all session behavior is controlled by properties that are exposed by the various session modules.
Users now configure session management by selecting a composition of session modules.

===== Change Overview

SessionIdManager:: Previously there was a different class of SessionIdManager - with different configuration options - depending upon which type of clustering technology chosen.
In Jetty 9.4, there is only one type, the link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionIdManager.html[org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.DefaultSessionIdManager].

SessionManager:: Previously, there was a different class of SessionManager depending upon which the type of clustering technology chosen.
In Jetty 9.4 we have removed the SessionManager class and split its functionality into different, more easily extensible and composable classes:
General setters:::
All of the common setup of sessions such as the maxInactiveInterval and session cookie-related configuration has been moved to the link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionHandler.html[org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.SessionHandler]

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| 9.3 SessionManager | 9.4 SessionHandler
| `setMaxInactiveInterval(sec)`    |  `setMaxInactiveInterval(sec)`
| `setSessionCookie(String)` | `setSessionCookie(String)`
| `setRefreshCookieAge(sec)` | `setRefreshCookieAge(sec)`
| `setSecureRequestOnly(boolean)` |  `setSecureRequestOnly(boolean)`
| `setSessionIdPathParameterName(String)` | `setSessionIdPathParameterName(String)`
| `setSessionTrackingModes(Set<SessionTrackingMode>)` | `setSessionTrackingModes(Set<SessionTrackingMode>)`
| `setHttpOnly(boolean)` | `setHttpOnly(boolean)`
| `setUsingCookies(boolean)` | `setUsingCookies(boolean)`
| `setCheckingRemoteSessionIdEncoding(boolean)` | `setCheckingRemoteSessionIdEncoding(boolean)`
|===

Persistence:::
In Jetty 9.3 `SessionManagers` (and sometimes `SessionIdManagers`) implemented the persistence mechanism.
In Jetty 9.4 we have moved this functionality into the link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionDataStore.html[`org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.SessionDataStore`].

Session cache:::
In Jetty 9.3 the `SessionManager` held a map of session objects in memory.
In Jetty 9.4 this has been moved into the new link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionCache.html[`org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.SessionCache`] interface.

For more information, please refer to the documentation on link:#jetty-sessions-architecture[Jetty Session Architecture.]

===== Default Sessions

As with earlier versions of Jetty, if you do not explicitly configure any session modules, the default session infrastructure will be enabled.
In previous versions of Jetty this was referred to as "hash" session management.
The new default provides similar features to the old hash session management:

* A session scavenger thread that runs every 10mins and removes expired sessions
* A session id manager that generates unique session ids and handles session id sharing during context forwarding
* An in-memory cache of session objects.

Requests for the same session in the same context share the same session object.
Session objects remain in the cache until they expire or are explicitly invalidated.

If you wish to configure the default setup further, enable the `session-cache-hash` module.

*Compatibility*

As Session objects do not persist beyond a server restart, there are no compatibility issues.


===== Sessions using the Filesystem

In earlier versions of Jetty, persisting sessions to the local filesystem was an option of the "hash" session manager.
In Jetty 9.4 this has been refactored to its own configurable module `session-store-file`.

*Compatibility*

Sessions stored to files by earlier versions of jetty are not compatible with jetty-9.4 sessions.
Here is a comparison of file formats, note that the file contents are listed in order of file output:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Jetty 9.3 | Jetty 9.4
| File name: `sessionid` | File name: `expirytime_contextpath_vhost_sessionid`
| `sessionid  (utf)`  | `sessionid (utf)`
|                   | `contextpath (utf)`
|                   | `vhost (utf)`
| `nodeid  (utf)` |  `lastnode (utf)`
| `createtime (long)` | `createtime (long)`
| `accessed (long)` | `accessed (long)`
|                 | `lastaccessed (long)`
|                 | `cookiesettime (long)`
|                 | `expiry (long)`
| `requests (int)`  |
|                 | `maxInactive (long)`
| `attributes size (int)` | `attributes size (int)`
| `attributes serialized (obj)` | `attributes serialized (obj)`
| `maxInactive (long)` |
|===

____
[NOTE]
Session data is now only loaded when requested.
Previous functionality such as `setLazyLoad` has been removed.
____


===== JDBC Sessions

As with earlier versions of Jetty, sessions may be persisted to a relational database.
Enable the `session-store-jdbc` module.

*Compatibility*

Sessions stored to the database by earlier versions of jetty are not compatible with jetty-9.4 sessions.
The incompatibility is minor:  in jetty-9.4 the `rowid` primary key column is no longer used, and the primary key is a composite of `(sessionid,contextpath,vhost)` columns.

===== NoSQL Sessions

As with earlier versions of Jetty, sessions may be persisted to a document database.
Jetty supports the Mongo document database.
Enable the `session-store-mongo` module.


*Compatibility*

Sessions stored to mongo by earlier versions of jetty are not compatible with jetty-9.4 sessions.
The key for each subdocument that represents the session information for a context is different between jetty-9.3 and 9.4:


[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Jetty 9.3 | Jetty 9.4
|Each context key is: vhost+context+path, where empty vhosts="::" and root context = "*" and / is replaced by _
|Each context key is: vhost:contextpath, where empty vhosts="0_0_0_0" and root context = "" and / replaced by _
| eg "::/contextA" | eg " 0_0_0_0:_contextA"
|===


===== Infinispan Sessions

As with earlier versions of Jetty, sessions may be clustered via Infinispan to either an in-process or remote infinispan instance.
Enable the `session-store-infinispan` module.

*Compatibility*

Sessions stored in infinispan by jetty-9.3 are incompatible with jetty-9.4.
In Jetty 9.3 the serialized object stored to represent the session data was `org.eclipse.jetty.session.infinispan.SerializableSessionData`.
In Jetty 9.4 the serialized object is `org.eclipse.jetty.serer.session.SessionData`.

===== GCloud Datastore

As with earlier versions of Jetty, sessions may be persisted to Google's GCloud Datastore.
Enable the `session-store-gcloud` module.

*Compatibility*

Sessions stored into GCloud Datastore by Jetty 9.3 are *incompatible* with Jetty 9.4, although the incompatibility is trivial: the name of the session id entity property has changed:

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Jetty 9.3 | Jetty 9.4
|Kind: `GCloudSession` | Kind: `GCloudSession`
|key: `contextpath_vhost_sessionid` | key: `contextpath_vhost_sessionid`
|*"clusterId"*: `sessionId` | *"id"*: `sessionId`
|"contextPath" : `contextpath` | "contextPath": `contextpath`
|"vhost" : `vhost` | "vhost": `vhost`
|"accessed": `accesstime` | "accessed": `accesstime`
|"lastAccessed": `lastaccesstime` | "lastAccessed": `lastaccesstime`
|"createTime": `createtime` | "createTime": `createtime`
|"cookieSetTime": `cookiesettime` | "cookieSetTime": `cookiesettime`
|"lastNode": `lastnode` | "lastNode": `lastnode`
|"expiry": `expiry` | "expiry": `expiry`
|"maxInactive": `maxInactive` | "maxInactive": `maxInactive`
|"attributes": `blob` | "attributes": `blob`
|===

===== GCloud Datastore with Memcached

As with earlier versions of Jetty, sessions can be both persisted to Google's GCloud Datastore, and cached into Memcached for faster access.
Enable the `session-store-gcloud` and `session-store-cache` modules.

*Compatibility*

Sessions stored into Memcached by earlier versions of jetty are incompatible with Jetty 9.4.
Previous versions of jetty stored `org.eclipse.jetty.gcloud.memcached.session.SerializableSessionData` whereas Jetty 9.4 stores `org.eclipse.jetty.server.session.SessionData`.

==== ServletContainerInitializers

As of Jetty-9.4.4, unless the `web.xml` is version 3.0 or greater, only `ServletContainerInitializers` that are on the container classpath will be discovered.
Users wishing to use `ServletContainerInitializers` from within the webapp with older versions of `web.xml` must either upgrade their `web.xml` version, or call `WebAppContext.setConfigurationDiscovered(true)` either programmatically or in xml.
Upgrading the `web.xml` version is preferable.
