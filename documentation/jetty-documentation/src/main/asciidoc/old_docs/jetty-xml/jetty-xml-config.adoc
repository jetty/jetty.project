[[jetty-xml-config]]
=== jetty.xml

`jetty.xml` is the default configuration file for Jetty, typically located at `$JETTY_HOME/etc/jetty.xml`. Usually the `jetty.xml` configures:

* The Server class (or subclass if extended) and global options.
* A ThreadPool (min and max thread).
* Connectors (ports, timeouts, buffer sizes, protocol).
* The handler structure (default handlers and/or a contextHandlerCollections).
* The deployment manager that scans for and deploys webapps and contexts.
* Login services that provide authentication checking.
* A request log.

Not all Jetty features are configured in `jetty.xml`.
There are several optional configuration files that share the same format as `jetty.xml` and, if specified, concatenate to it.
These configuration files are also stored in `$JETTY_HOME/etc/`, and examples of them are in http://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/jetty-server/src/main/config/etc/[Github Repository].
The selection of which configuration files to use is controlled by `start.jar` and the process of merging configuration is described in xref:jetty-xml-usage[].
