=== Configuring Jetty Logging

Jetty provides logging via its own `org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Logger` layer, and does not natively use any existing Java logging framework.
All logging events, produced via the Jetty logging layer, have a name, a level, and a message.
The name is a FQCN (fully qualified class name) similar to how all existing Java logging frameworks operate.

Jetty logging, however, has a slightly different set of levels that it uses internally:

WARN::
  For events serious enough to inform and log, but not fatal.
INFO::
  Informational events.
DEBUG::
  Debugging events (very noisy).
IGNORE::
  Exception events that you can safely ignore, but useful for some people.
  You might see this level as DEBUG under some Java logging framework configurations, where it retains the _ignore_ phrase somewhere in the logging.
____
[NOTE]
Jetty logging produces no FATAL or SEVERE events.

==== Selecting the Log Framework

Configure the Jetty logging layer via the `org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Log` class, following link:{GITBROWSEURL}/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/log/Log.java[these rules].

1.  Load Properties
* First from a Classpath Resource called `jetty-logging.properties` (if found).
* Then from the `System.getProperties()`.
2.  Determine the log implementation.
* If property `org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class` is defined, load the class it defines as the logger implementation from the server `classpath`.
* If the class `org.slf4j.Logger` exists in server classpath, the Jetty implementation becomes `org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Slf4jLog`.
* If no logger implementation is specified, default to `org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.StdErrLog`.
____
[NOTE]
You can create your own custom logging by providing an implementation of the link:{JDURL}org/eclipse/jetty/util/log/Logger.html[Jetty Logger API].
For an example of a custom logger, see link:{GITBROWSEURL}/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/log/JavaUtilLog.java[JavaUtilLog.java].

[[configuring-jetty-stderrlog]]
==== The jetty-logging.properties file

By default, the internal Jetty Logging discovery mechanism will load logging specific properties from a classpath resource called `jetty-logging.properties` and then initialize the Logging from a combination of properties found in that file, along with any System Properties.
A typical jetty-logging.properties file will include at least the declaration of which logging implementation you want to use by defining a value for the `org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class` property.

Examples for various logging frameworks can be found later in this documentation.
