=== Example: Logging with Apache Log4j

It is possible to have the Jetty Server logging configured so that Log4j controls the output of logging events produced by Jetty.
This is accomplished by configuring Jetty for logging to http://logging.apache.org/log4j/[Apache Log4j] via http://slf4j.org/manual.html[Slf4j] and the http://slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping[Slf4j binding layer for Log4j].

A convenient replacement `logging` module has been created to bootstrap your `${jetty.base}` directory for logging with log4j.

The replacement `logging.mod` performs a number of tasks.

. `mybase` is a `${jetty.base}` directory.
. The jetty-home is unpacked (and untouched) into `/opt/jetty-home/` and becomes the `${jetty.home}` directory for this demonstration.
. The `curl` command downloads the replacement `logging.mod` and puts it into the `${jetty.base}/modules/` directory for use by mybase only.
. The `start.jar --add-to-start=logging` command performs a number of steps to make the logging module available to the `${jetty.base}` configuration.
.. The `--modules=logging` command is added to the `${jetty.base}/start.ini` configuration.
.. Required `${jetty.base}` directories are created: `${jetty.base}/logs` and `${jetty.base}/resources`
.. Required libraries are downloaded (if not present already): slf4j-api, slf4j-log4j, and log4j itself.
* The libraries are put in the `${jetty.base}/lib/logging/` directory.
.. Required configuration files are downloaded (if not present already): `jetty-logging.properties`, and `log4j.properties`
* The configuration files are placed in the `${jetty.base}/resources/` directory.

At this point the Jetty `mybase` is configured so that the Jetty server itself will log using log4j, using the log4j configuration found in `mybase/resources/log4j.properties`.

The server classpath can be verified by using the `start.jar --list-config` command.

In essence, Jetty is now configured to emit its own logging events to slf4j, and slf4j itself is using the static log binder found in `slf4j-log4j12.jar`, making all Jetty + Slf4j + Log4j events emitted by the Jetty server go to Log4j for routing (to console, file, syslog, etc...).
