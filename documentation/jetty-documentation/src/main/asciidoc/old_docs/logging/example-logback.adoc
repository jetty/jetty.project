=== Example: Logging with Logback

It is possible to have the Jetty Server logging configured so that Logback controls the output of logging events produced by Jetty.
This is accomplished by configuring Jetty for logging to `Logback`, which uses http://slf4j.org/manual.html[Slf4j] and the http://logback.qos.ch/[Logback Implementation for Slf4j].

A convenient replacement `logging` module has been created to bootstrap the `${jetty.base}` directory for logging with logback.

The replacement `logging.mod` performs a number of tasks.

. `mybase` is a `${jetty.base}` directory.
. The jetty-home is unpacked (and untouched) into `/opt/jetty-home/` and becomes the `${jetty.home}` directory for this demonstration.
. The `curl` command downloads the replacement `logging.mod` and puts it into the `${jetty.base}/modules/` directory for use by `mybase` only.
. The `start.jar --add-to-start=logging` command performs a number of steps to make the logging module available to the `${jetty.base}` configuration.
.. The `--module=logging` command is added to the `${jetty.base}/start.ini` configuration.
.. Required `${jetty.base}` directories are created: `${jetty.base}/logs` and `${jetty.base}/resources`.
.. Required libraries are downloaded (if not present already) to the `${jetty.base}/lib/logging/` directory: slf4j-api, logback-core, and logback-classic.
.. Required configuration files are downloaded (if not present already) to the `${jetty.base}/lib/resources/` directory.: `jetty-logging.properties`, and `logback.xml`.

At this point the Jetty `mybase` is configured so that the Jetty server itself will log using Logback, using the Logback configuration found in `mybase/resources/logback.xml`

The server classpath can be verified by using the `start.jar --list-config` command.

In essence, Jetty is now configured to emit its own logging events to slf4j, and slf4j itself is using the static log binder found in logback-classic.jar, making all Jetty + Slf4j + Logback events emitted by the Jetty server go to Logback for routing (to console, file, syslog, etc...).
