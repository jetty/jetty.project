[[garbage-collection]]
=== Garbage Collection

Tuning the JVM garbage collection (GC) can greatly improve the performance of the JVM where Jetty and your application are running.
Optimal tuning of the GC depends on the behavior of the application(s) and requires detailed analysis, but there are general recommendations to follow to at least obtain comprehensive GC logs that can be later analyzed.

See official https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/[Java 8] and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/gctuning/introduction-garbage-collection-tuning.htm[Java 9] Garbage Collection documentation for further assistance.

==== Garbage Collection Logging Configuration

These options are general to OpenJDK (and therefore also for the Oracle JVM).
They provide good information about the GC activity of your JVM, producing logs that can later be analyzed to perform finer tuning.

.JDK 8 Garbage Collection Logging Configuration
[source,screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
-Xloggc:/path/to/myjettybase/logs/gc.log
-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
-XX:+PrintGCDetails
-XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled
-XX:+PrintReferenceGC
-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
-XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy
....

.JDK 9 Garbage Collection Logging Configuration
[source,screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
Xlog:gc*,ergo*=trace,ref*=debug,age*=trace:file=/path/to/myjettybase/logs/gc.log:time,level,tags
....

There are not many recommended options for GC that can apply to all users.
However, the most obvious one is to disable explicit GC (this is performed regularly by RMI and can introduce an abnormal amount of GC pauses).

[source,screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
....
-XX:+DisableExplicitGC
