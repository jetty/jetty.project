==== Deploying Web Applications

You can deploy two types of web application resources with Jetty:

* *Standard Web Application Archives*, in the form of `+*.war+` files or web application directories, defined by the link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-servlet-tec.html[Servlet specification].
Their deployment is described in xref:og-begin-deploy-war[this section].
* *Jetty context XML files*, that allow you to customize the deployment of standard web applications, and also allow you use Jetty components -- and possibly custom components written by you -- to assemble your web applications.
Their deployment is described in xref:og-deploy[this section].

[[og-begin-deploy-war]]
===== Deploying +*.war+ Files

A standard Servlet web application is packaged in either a `+*.war+` file or in a directory with the structure of a `+*.war+` file.

[NOTE]
====
Recall that the structure of a `+*.war+` file is as follows:

[source,subs=verbatim]
----
mywebapp.war
├── index.html <1>
└── WEB-INF <2>
    ├── classes/ <3>
    ├── lib/ <4>
    └── web.xml <5>
----
<1> Publicly accessible resources such as `+*.html+`, `+*.jsp+`, `+*.css+`, `+*.js+` files, etc. are placed in `+*.war+` or in sub-directories of the `+*.war+`.
<2> `WEB-INF` is a special directory used to store anything related to the web application that must not be publicly accessible, but may be accessed by other resources.
<3> `WEB-INF/classes` stores the web application's compiled `+*.class+` files
<4> `WEB-INF/classes` stores the web application's `+*.jar+` files
<5> `WEB-INF/web.xml` is the web application deployment descriptor, which defines the components and the configuration of your web application.
====

To deploy a standard web application, you need to enable the xref:og-module-eeN-deploy[`{ee-current}-deploy` module].

NOTE: The following examples assume you're deploying a Jakarta {ee-current-caps} application; for other versions of Jakarta EE, make sure to activate the corresponding `{ee-all}-deploy` module.

[subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module={ee-current}-deploy
----

[source,options=nowrap]
----
include::jetty[setupArgs="--add-module=http",args="--add-module={ee-current}-deploy"]
----

The `{ee-current}-deploy` module creates `$JETTY_BASE/webapps`, which is the directory where Jetty looks for any `+*.war+` files or web application directories to deploy.

Activating one of Jetty's `{ee-all}-deploy` modules enables web application deployment.
Whether these web applications are served via clear-text HTTP/1.1, or secure HTTP/1.1, or secure HTTP/2, or HTTP/3 (or even all of these protocols) depends on if the correspondent Jetty modules have been enabled.
Refer to the xref:og-protocols[section about protocols] for further information.

Now you're ready to copy a web application to the `$JETTY_BASE/webapps` directory.
You can use one of the demos shipped with Jetty:

[subs=attributes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module={ee-current}-demo-simple
----

The `$JETTY_BASE` directory is now:

[subs=attributes]
----
$JETTY_BASE
├── resources
│   └── jetty-logging.properties
├── start.d
│   ├── deploy.ini
│   ├── {ee-current}-demo-simple.ini
│   └── http.ini
└── webapps
    └── {ee-current}-demo-simple.war
----

Now start Jetty:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar
----

[source,subs=quotes,options=nowrap]
----
include::jetty[setupArgs="--add-modules=http,deploy,{ee-current}-demo-simple",highlight="WebAppContext"]
----

Note the highlighted line that logs the deployment of `{ee-current}-demo-simple.war`.

Now you can access the web application by pointing your browser to `pass:a[http://localhost:8080/{ee-current}-demo-simple]`.

===== Advanced Deployment

If you want to customize the deployment of your web application -- for example, by specifying a `contextPath` different from the file/directory name, or by specifying JNDI entries, or by specifying virtual hosts -- read xref:og-deploy[this section].
