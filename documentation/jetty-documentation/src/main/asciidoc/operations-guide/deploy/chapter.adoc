[[og-deploy]]
=== Web Application Deployment

Most of the times you want to be able to customize the deployment of your web applications, for example by changing the `contextPath`, or by adding JNDI entries, or by configuring virtual hosts, etc.

The customization is performed by the xref:og-module-deploy[`deploy` module] by processing xref:og-deploy-jetty[Jetty context XML files].

The `deploy` module contains the `DeploymentManager` component that scans the `$JETTY_BASE/webapps` directory for changes, following the deployment rules described in xref:og-deploy-rules[this section].

// TODO: configuring from the Jetty context XML file happens before web.xml
//  What about jetty-web.xml? Can this be specified externally, e.g. WebAppContext.setJettyWebXml() ?
