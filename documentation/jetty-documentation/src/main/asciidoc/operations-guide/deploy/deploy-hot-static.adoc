==== Hot vs Static Deployment

The `DeploymentManager` scans the `$JETTY_BASE/webapps` directory for changes every `N` seconds, where `N` is configured via the `jetty.deploy.scanInterval` property.

By default, the scan interval is `1` second, which means that _hot_ deployment is enabled: if a file is added/changed/removed from the `$JETTY_BASE/webapps` directory, the `DeploymentManager` will notice the change and respectively deploy/redeploy/undeploy the web application.

Setting the scan interval to `0` means that _static_ deployment is enabled, and the `DeploymentManager` will not scan the `$JETTY_BASE/webapps` directory for changes.
This means that to deploy/redeploy/undeploy a web application you will need to stop and restart Jetty.

The following command line disables _hot_ deployment by specifying the `jetty.deploy.scanInterval` property on the command line, and therefore only for this particular run:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar jetty.deploy.scanInterval=0
----

To make _static_ deployment persistent, you need to edit the appropriate `<env>-deploy` module configuration file, `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/<env>-deploy.ini` (eg: `ee10-deploy.ini`), uncomment the module property `jetty.deploy.scanInterval` and change its value to `0`:

.<env>-deploy.ini
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
--module=deploy
#jetty.deploy.scanInterval=0#
...
----
