==== Configuring Virtual Hosts

A _virtual host_ is an internet domain name, registered in the Domain Name Server (DNS), for an IP address such that multiple virtual hosts will resolve to the same IP address of a single server instance.

If you have multiple web applications deployed on the same Jetty server, by using virtual hosts you will be able to target a specific web application.

For example, you may have a web application for your business and a web application for your hobbies , both deployed in the same Jetty server.
By using virtual hosts, you will be able to have the first web application available at `+http://domain.biz/+`, and the second web application available at `+http://hobby.net/+`.

Another typical case is when you want to use different subdomains for different web application, for example a project website is at `+http://project.org/+` and the project documentation is at `+http://docs.project.org+`.

Virtual hosts can be used with any context that is a subclass of link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/ContextHandler.html[ContextHandler].

[[og-deploy-virtual-hosts-names]]
===== Virtual Host Names

Jetty supports the following variants to be specified as virtual host names:

`www.hostname.com`::
A fully qualified domain name. It is important to list all variants as a site may receive traffic for both `www.hostname.com` and `hostname.com`.

`*.hostname.com`::
A wildcard domain name which will match only one level of arbitrary subdomains.
*.foo.com will match www.foo.com and m.foo.com, but not www.other.foo.com.

`10.0.0.2`::
An IP address may be set as a virtual host to indicate that a web application should handle requests received on the network interface with that IP address for protocols that do not indicate a host name such as HTTP/0.9 or HTTP/1.0.

`@ConnectorName`::
A Jetty server `Connector` name to indicate that a web application should handle requests received on the server `Connector` with that name, and therefore received on a specific socket address (either an IP port for `ServerConnector`, or a Unix-Domain path for `UnixDomainServerConnector`).
A server `Connector` name can be set via link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/AbstractConnector.html#setName(java.lang.String)[].

`www.√integral.com`::
Non-ASCII and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name[IDN] domain names can be set as virtual hosts using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode[Puny Code] equivalents that may be obtained from a https://www.punycoder.com/[Punycode/IDN converters].
For example if the non-ASCII domain name `www.√integral.com` is given to a browser, then the browser will make a request that uses the domain name `www.xn--integral-7g7d.com`, which is the name that should be added as the virtual host name.

[[og-deploy-virtual-hosts-config]]
===== Virtual Hosts Configuration

If you have a web application `mywebapp.war` you can configure its virtual hosts in this way:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_10_0.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <Set name="contextPath">/mywebapp</Set>
  <Set name="war">/opt/webapps/mywebapp.war</Set>
  <Set name="virtualHosts">
    <Array type="java.lang.String">
      <Item>mywebapp.com</Item>
      <Item>www.mywebapp.com</Item>
      <Item>mywebapp.net</Item>
      <Item>www.mywebapp.net</Item>
    </Array>
  </Set>
</Configure>
----

Your web application will be available at:

* `+http://mywebapp.com/mywebapp+`
* `+http://www.mywebapp.com/mywebapp+`
* `+http://mywebapp.net/mywebapp+`
* `+http://www.mywebapp.net/mywebapp+`

[NOTE]
====
You configured the `contextPath` of your web application to `/mywebapp`.

As such, a request to `+http://mywebapp.com/other+` will not match your web application because the `contextPath` does not match.

Likewise, a request to `+http://other.com/mywebapp+` will not match your web application because the virtual host does not match.
====

[[og-deploy-virtual-hosts-same-context]]
===== Same Context Path, Different Virtual Hosts

If you want to deploy different web applications to the same context path, typically the root context path `/`, you must use virtual hosts to differentiate among web applications.

You have `domain.war` that you want to deploy at `+http://domain.biz/+` and `hobby.war` that you want to deploy at `+http://hobby.net+`.

To achieve this, you simply use the same context path of `/` for each of your webapps, while specifying different virtual hosts for each of your webapps:

.domain.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_10_0.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <Set name="contextPath">/</Set>
  <Set name="war">/opt/webapps/domain.war</Set>
  <Set name="virtualHosts">
    <Array type="java.lang.String">
      <Item>domain.biz</Item>
    </Array>
  </Set>
</Configure>
----

.hobby.xml
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_10_0.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <Set name="contextPath">/</Set>
  <Set name="war">/opt/webapps/hobby.war</Set>
  <Set name="virtualHosts">
    <Array type="java.lang.String">
      <Item>hobby.net</Item>
    </Array>
  </Set>
</Configure>
----

[[og-deploy-virtual-hosts-port]]
===== Different Port, Different Web Application

Sometimes it is required to serve different web applications from different socket addresses (either different IP ports, or different Unix-Domain paths), and therefore from different server ``Connector``s.

For example, you want requests to `+http://localhost:8080/+` to be served by one web application, but requests to `+http://localhost:9090/+` to be served by another web application.

This configuration may be useful when Jetty sits behind a load balancer.

In this case, you want to xref:og-protocols[configure multiple connectors], each with a different name, and then reference the connector name in the web application virtual host configuration:

.domain.xml
[source,xml,highlight=10]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_10_0.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <Set name="contextPath">/</Set>
  <Set name="war">/opt/webapps/domain.war</Set>
  <Set name="virtualHosts">
    <Array type="java.lang.String">
      <Item>@port8080</Item>
    </Array>
  </Set>
</Configure>
----

.hobby.xml
[source,xml,highlight=10]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_10_0.dtd">

<Configure class="org.eclipse.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext">
  <Set name="contextPath">/</Set>
  <Set name="war">/opt/webapps/hobby.war</Set>
  <Set name="virtualHosts">
    <Array type="java.lang.String">
      <Item>@port9090</Item>
    </Array>
  </Set>
</Configure>
----

[NOTE]
====
Web application `domain.war` has a virtual host of `@port8080`, where `port8080` is the name of a Jetty connector.

Likewise, web application `hobby.war` has a virtual host of `@port9090`, where `port9090` is the name of another Jetty connector.

See xref:og-protocols[this section] for further information about how to configure connectors.
