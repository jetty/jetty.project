=== Eclipse Jetty Monitoring & Management

Monitoring and management of a Jetty server is important because it allows you to monitor the status of the server (_"Is the server processing requests?"_) and to manage -- i.e. read and possibly change -- its configuration.

The ability to read and change the Jetty configuration is very important for troubleshooting Jetty -- please refer to the xref:og-troubleshooting[troubleshooting section] for more information.

Jetty relies on the Java Management Extensions (JMX) APIs included in OpenJDK to provide monitoring and management.

The JMX APIs support a JVM-local `MBeanServer`, accessible only from within the JVM itself (or by tools that can _attach_ to a running JVM), and a way to expose the `MBeanServer` to remote clients via Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
