=== Configuring SSL/TLS KeyStores

A KeyStore is a file on the file system that contains a private key and a public certificate, along with the certificate chain of the certificate authorities that issued the certificate.
The private key, the public certificate and the certificate chain, but more generally the items present in a KeyStore, are typically referred to as "cryptographic material".

Keystores may encode the cryptographic material with different encodings, the most common being link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12[PKCS12], and are typically protected by a password.

Refer to the xref:og-protocols-ssl[secure protocols section] for more information about how to configure a secure connector using a KeyStore.
