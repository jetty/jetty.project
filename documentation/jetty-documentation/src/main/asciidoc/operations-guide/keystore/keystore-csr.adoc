==== Creating a Certificate Signing Request

Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers and generic clients: you need to establish a trust chain by having your self-signed certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA).

Browsers and generic clients (e.g. Java clients) have an internal list of trusted certificate authorities root certificates; they use these trusted certificates to verify the certificate they received from the server when they connect to your web applications.

To have your self-signed certificate signed by a certificate authority you first need to produce a _certificate signing request_ (CSR):

[source]
----
keytool
    -certreq <1>
    -file domain.com.csr <2>
    -keystore keystore.p12 <3>
----
<1> the command to generate a certificate signing request
<2> the file to save the CSR
<3> the keystore that contains the self-signed certificate

Then, you have to send the CSR file to the certificate authority of your choice, and wait for their reply (they will probably require a proof that you really own the domains indicated in your certificate).

Eventually, the certificate authority will reply to you with one or more files containing the CA certificate chain, and your certificate signed by their certificate chain.

==== Importing the Signed Certificate

The file you receive from the CA is typically in PEM format, and you *must* import it back into the same KeyStore file you used to generate the CSR.
You must import *both* the certificate chain and your signed certificate.

First, import the certificate chain:

[source]
----
keytool
    -importcert <1>
    -alias ca <2>
    -file chain_from_ca.pem <3>
    -keystore keystore.p12 <4>
    -trustcacerts <5>
    -v <6>
----
<1> the command to import certificates
<2> use the `ca` alias to differentiate from the alias of the server certificate
<3> the file containing the certificate chain received from the CA
<4> your KeyStore file
<5> specify that you trust CA certificates
<6> verbose output

Then, import the signed certificate:

----
keytool
    -importcert
    -file signed_certificate.pem
    -keystore keystore.p12
    -trustcacerts
    -v
----

Now you have a trusted certificate in your KeyStore that you can use for the domains of your web applications.

// TODO: add a section about renewal?

Refer to the section about configuring xref:og-protocols-ssl[secure protocols] to configure the secure connector with your newly created KeyStore.
