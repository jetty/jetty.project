===== Module `bytebufferpool`

The `bytebufferpool` module allows you to configure the server-wide `ByteBuffer` pool.
Pooling ``ByteBuffer``s results in less memory usage and less pressure on the Garbage Collector.

``ByteBuffer``s are pooled in _buckets_; each bucket as a capacity that is a multiple of a capacity factor that you can configure.
For example, if a request for a `ByteBuffer` of capacity 2000 is requested, and the capacity factor is 1024, then the pool will allocate a buffer from the second bucket, of capacity 2048 (1024 * 2).

Applications that need to sustain many concurrent requests -- or load spikes -- may require many buffers during peak load. These buffers will remain pooled once the system transitions to a lighter load (or becomes idle), and it may be undesirable to retain a lot of memory for an idle system.

It is possible to configure the max heap memory and the max direct memory that the pool retains.
Excess buffers will not be pooled and will be eventually garbage collected.

The module file is `$JETTY_HOME/modules/bytebufferpool.mod`:

----
include::{jetty-home}/modules/bytebufferpool.mod[]
----

Among the configurable properties, the most relevant are:

`jetty.byteBufferPool.maxHeapMemory`::
This property allows you to cap the max heap memory retained by the pool.

`jetty.byteBufferPool.maxDirectMemory`::
This property allows you to cap the max direct memory retained by the pool.
