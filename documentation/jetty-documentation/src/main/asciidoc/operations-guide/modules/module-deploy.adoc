===== Module `deploy`

The `deploy` module provides the deployment feature through a `DeploymentManager` component that watches a directory for changes (see xref:og-deploy[how to deploy web applications] for more information).

Files or directories added in this monitored directory cause the `DeploymentManager` to deploy them as web applications; updating files already existing in this monitored directory cause the `DeploymentManager` to re-deploy the correspondent web application; removing files in this monitored directory cause the `DeploymentManager` to undeploy the correspondent web application (see also xref:og-deploy-rules[here] for more information).

The module file is `$JETTY_HOME/modules/deploy.mod`:

----
include::{JETTY_HOME}/modules/deploy.mod[]
----

Among the configurable properties, the most relevant are:

`jetty.deploy.monitoredDir`::
The name of the monitored directory.
`jetty.deploy.scanInterval`::
The scan period in seconds, that is how frequently the `DeploymentManager` wakes up to scan the monitored directory for changes.
Setting `jetty.deploy.scanInterval=0` disabled _hot_ deployment so that only static deployment will be possible (see also xref:og-deploy-hot-static[here] for more information).
