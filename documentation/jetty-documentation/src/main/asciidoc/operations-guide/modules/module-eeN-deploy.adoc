===== Module `{ee-all}-deploy`

include::{jetty-home}/modules/{ee-current}-deploy.mod[tags=description]

Deployment is managed via a `DeploymentManager` component that watches a directory for changes.
See xref:og-deploy[how to deploy web applications] for more information.

Adding files or directories to this monitored directory will cause the `DeploymentManager` to deploy them as web applications; updating files already existing in this monitored directory will cause the `DeploymentManager` to re-deploy the corresponding web application; removing files in this monitored directory will cause the `DeploymentManager` to "undeploy" the corresponding web application.
(You can find a more detailed discussion of these rules in the xref:og-deploy-rules[deployment rules] section.)

Multiple versions of this module exist (`{ee-all}-deploy`) to support each Jakarta EE platform's version of the Java Servlet specification.
Jetty's configuration properties are nearly identical across these versions; the configuration properties for the `{ee-current}-deploy` Jetty module are:

----
include::{jetty-home}/modules/{ee-current}-deploy.mod[tags=ini-template]
----

Among the configurable properties, the most relevant are:

`jetty.deploy.monitoredDir`::
The name of the monitored directory.
`jetty.deploy.scanInterval`::
The scan period in seconds, that is how frequently the `DeploymentManager` wakes up to scan the monitored directory for changes.
Setting `jetty.deploy.scanInterval=0` disabled _hot_ deployment so that only static deployment will be possible (see also xref:og-deploy-hot-static[here] for more information).
