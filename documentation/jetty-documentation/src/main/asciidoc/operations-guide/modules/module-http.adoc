===== Module `http`

The `http` module provides the clear-text connector and support for the clear-text HTTP/1.1 protocol, and depends on the xref:og-module-server[`server` module].

The module properties to configure the clear-text connector are:

----
include::{JETTY_HOME}/modules/http.mod[tags=documentation]
----

Among the configurable properties, the most relevant are:

`jetty.http.port`::
The network port that Jetty listens to for clear-text HTTP/1.1 connections -- default `8080`.
`jetty.http.idleTimeout`::
The amount of time a connection can be idle (i.e. no bytes received and no bytes sent) until the server decides to close it to save resources -- default `30` seconds.
`jetty.http.acceptors`::
The number of threads that compete to accept connections -- default 1. Use -1 to let the accept heuristic decides the value; the current heuristic calculates a value based on the number of cores).
Refer to xref:og-module-http-acceptors[this section] for more information about acceptor threads.
`jetty.http.selectors`::
The number of NIO selectors (with an associated thread) that manage connections -- default -1 (i.e. a select heuristic decides the value; the current heuristic calculates a value based on the number of cores).

[[og-module-http-acceptors]]
====== Configuration of Acceptors

Accepting connections from remote clients may be configured as a blocking operation, or a non-blocking operation.

When accepting connections is configured as a blocking operation (the number of acceptors is greater than zero), a thread is blocked in the `accept()` call until a connection is accepted, and other acceptor threads (if any) are blocked on the lock acquired by the accepting thread just before the `accept()` call.

When the accepting thread accepts a connection, it performs a little processing of the just accepted connection, before forwarding it to other components.

During this little processing other connections may be established; if there is only one accepting thread, the newly established connections are waiting for the accepting thread to finish the processing of the previously accepted connection and call again `accept()`.

Servers that manage a very high number of connections that may (naturally) come and go, or that handle inefficient protocols that open and close connections very frequently (such as HTTP/1.0) may benefit of an increased number of acceptor threads, so that when one acceptor thread processes a just accepted connection, another acceptor thread can immediately take over accepting connections.

When accepting connections is configured as a non-blocking operation (the number of acceptors is zero), then the server socket is set in non-blocking mode and added to a NIO selector.
In this way, no dedicated acceptor threads exist: the work of accepting connections is performed by the selector thread.

[[og-module-http-selectors]]
====== Configuration of Selectors

Performing a NIO `select()` call is a blocking operation, where the selecting thread is blocked in the `select()` call until at least one connection is ready to be processed for an I/O operation.
There are 4 I/O operations: ready to be accepted, ready to be connected, ready to be read and ready to be written.

A single NIO selector can manage thousands of connections, with the assumption that not many of them will be ready at the same time.

For a single NIO selector, the ratio between the average number of selected connections over the total number of connections for every `select()` call depends heavily on the protocol but also on the application.

Multiplexed TCP protocols such as HTTP/2 tend to be busier than duplex protocols such as HTTP/1.1, leading to a higher ratio.

REST applications that exchange many little JSON messages tend to be busier than file server applications, leading to a higher ratio.

The higher the ratio, the higher the number of selectors you want to have, compatibly with the number of cores -- there is no point in having 64 selector threads on a single core hardware.
