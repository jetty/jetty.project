===== Module `jmx-remote`

The `jmx-remote` module provides remote access to JMX clients.

The module properties to configure remote JMX connector are:

----
include::{JETTY_HOME}/modules/jmx-remote.mod[tags=documentation]
----

The system property `java.rmi.server.hostname` is specified with the usual notation, prepending a `-D` in front of the system property name.

The system property `java.rmi.server.hostname` is uncommented because it is necessary in the default configuration -- most systems do not have the local name resolution configured properly for remote access.

As an example, in a Linux machine named `beryl`, the `/etc/hosts` file may contain these entries:

----
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 beryl
----

If the system property `java.rmi.server.hostname` is not specified, the RMI implementation uses the host name `beryl` to figure out the IP address to store in the RMI stub, in this case `127.0.1.1`.
However, we the RMI server is configured to bind to `localhost`, i.e. `127.0.0.1`.

If the system property `java.rmi.server.hostname` is not specified, the RMI client will try to connect to `127.0.1.1` (because that's what in the RMI stub) and fail because nothing is listening on that address.
