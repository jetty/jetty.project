===== Module `threadpool`

The `threadpool` module allows you to configure the server-wide thread pool.

The thread pool creates threads on demand up to `maxThreads`, and idles them out if they are not used.

Since Jetty uses the thread pool internally to execute critical tasks, it is not recommended to constrain the thread pool to small values of `maxThreads` with the purpose of limiting HTTP request concurrency, as this could very likely cause a server lockup when Jetty needs to run a critical task but there are no threads available.
Start with the default value of `maxThreads`, and tune for larger values if needed.

The module properties to configure the thread pool are:

----
include::{JETTY_HOME}/modules/threadpool.mod[tags=documentation]
----

Among the configurable properties, the most relevant are:

`jetty.threadPool.namePrefix`::
The name prefix to use for the thread names.

`jetty.threadPool.detailedDump`::
Whether the thread pool should dump the whole stack trace of each thread, or just the topmost stack frame -- defaults to `false`.

`jetty.threadPool.idleTimeout`::
The time, in milliseconds, after which an idle thread is released from the pool -- defaults to 60000, i.e. 60 seconds.

`jetty.threadPool.maxThreads`::
The max number of threads pooled by the thread pool -- defaults to 200.

If you want to use virtual threads, introduced as a preview feature in Java 19 and Java 20, and become an official feature since Java 21, use the following modules:

* The xref:og-module-threadpool-virtual[`threadpool-virtual`] Jetty module for Java 21 or later.
* The xref:og-module-threadpool-virtual-preview[`threadpool-virtual-preview`] Jetty module for Java 19 and Java 20.

See also the xref:og-server-threadpool[section about configuring the thread pool].
