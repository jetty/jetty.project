===== Module `well-known`

The `well-known` Jetty module creates a `ResourceHandler` deployed at the `/.well-known` context path which serves files from a directory.
By default, the directory created at `$JETTY_BASE/.well-known` is used, but it can be configured from `well-known.ini` to anywhere in the filesystem.
Note that the `.well-known` directory may be seen as a hidden directory by the filesystem.

The concept of well-known URIs has been defined in link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5785[RFC5785].
This module can be used for things like the automatic renewal of link:https://letsencrypt.org/[Let's Encrypt] certificates.
See link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml[IANA Well-Known URIs] for more possible examples of how this can be used.
