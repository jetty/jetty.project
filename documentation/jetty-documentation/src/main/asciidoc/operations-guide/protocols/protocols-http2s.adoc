==== Secure HTTP/2

When you enable secure HTTP/2 you typically want to enable also secure HTTP/1.1, for backwards compatibility reasons: in this way, old browsers or other clients that do not support HTTP/2 will be able to connect to your server.

You need to enable:

* the `ssl` Jetty module, which provides the secure connector and the KeyStore and TLS configuration
* the `http2` Jetty module, which adds ALPN handling and adds the HTTP/2 protocol to the secured connector
* optionally, the `https` Jetty module, which adds the HTTP/1.1 protocol to the secured connector

Use the following command (issued from within the `$JETTY_BASE` directory):

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=ssl,http2,https
----

As when enabling the `https` Jetty module, you need a valid KeyStore (read xref:og-keystore[this section] to create your own KeyStore).

As a quick example, you can enable the xref:og-module-test-keystore[`test-keystore` module], that creates on-the-fly a KeyStore containing a self-signed certificate:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=test-keystore
----

Starting Jetty yields:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar
----

[source,subs=quotes,options=nowrap]
----
include::jetty[setupArgs="--add-modules=ssl,http2,https,test-keystore",highlight="(\{.*:8443})"]
----

Note how Jetty is listening on port `8443` and the protocols supported are the sequence `(ssl, alpn, h2, http/1.1)`.

The (ordered) list of protocols after `alpn` are the _application protocols_, in the example above `(h2, http/1.1)`.

When a new connection is accepted by the connector, Jetty first interprets the TLS bytes, then it handles the ALPN negotiation knowing that the application protocols are (in order) `h2` and then `http/1.1`.

You can customize the list of application protocols and the default protocol to use in case the ALPN negotiation fails by editing the xref:og-module-alpn[`alpn` module] properties.

The HTTP/2 protocol parameters can be configured by editing the xref:og-module-http2[`http2` module] properties.
