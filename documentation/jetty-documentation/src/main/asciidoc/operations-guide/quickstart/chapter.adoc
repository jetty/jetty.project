=== Faster Web Application Deployment


The auto discovery features of the Servlet Specification can make deployments slow and uncertain.
Auto discovery of web application configuration can be useful during the development as it allows new features and frameworks to be enabled simply by dropping in a jar file.
However for production deployment, the need to scan the contents of many jars can have a significant impact at startup time.

The `quickstart` module allows a webapp to be pre-scanned, making startup predictable and faster.
During scanning all declarative configuration (ie from web.xml, web-fragment.xml and annotations) are encoded into an effective `web.xml`, called `WEB-INF/quickstart-web.xml`, which can be inspected to understand what will be deployed.

[NOTE]
====
Programmatic configuration is _not_ encoded into the generated `quickstart-web.xml` file.
====

With `quickstart`, webapps that took many seconds to scan and deploy can now be deployed in a few hundred milliseconds.

==== Enabling 

Enable the `quickstart` module for your jetty base:

----
$ cd $JETTY-BASE
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=quickstart
----

The `$JETTY-BASE/start.d/quickstart.ini` file contains these configurable parameters:

jetty.quickstart.mode::
 The values are:
 
 AUTO:::
 Allows jetty to run either with or without a `quickstart-web.xml` file.
 If jetty detects the file, then it will be used, otherwise the app is started normally.
 GENERATE:::
 In this mode, jetty will generate a `quickstart-web.xml` file and then terminate.
 Use this mode first before changing to either `AUTO` or `QUICKSTART`.
 QUICKSTART:::
 In this mode, if jetty does not detect a `quickstart-web.xml` file then jetty will not start.

jetty.quickstart.origin::
Use this parameter to set the name of the attribute in the `quickstart-web.xml` file that contains the origin of each element.
Knowing the descriptor or annotation from which each element derives can be useful for debugging.
Note that the origin attribute does not conform to the web xml schema, so if you deploy with xml validation, you'll see errors.
It is probably best to do a few trial runs with the attribute set, then turn it off for final generation.

jetty.quickstart.xml::
Use this parameter to change the name of the generated file.
By default this is `quickstart-web.xml` in the webapp's `WEB-INF` directory.
The file named by this parameter will always be interpreted relative to `WEB-INF`.

If your webapp is a war file, you will need to either first unpack it yourself, or use a context xml file (or code equivalent) that calls `WebAppContext.setExtractWAR(true)`.
If you allow Jetty to do the unpacking, it will use the usual mechanisms to find the location to which to unpack.
Note that by default Jetty unpacks to a temporary location which is _not_ reused between executions.
So either specify the directory to which to unpack, or make a `work` directory in your base to ensure the unpacked war is preserved and reused across restarts.
