=== HTTP Session Management

HTTP sessions are a concept within the Servlet API which allow requests to store and retrieve information across the time a user spends in an application.
Jetty offers a number of pluggable alternatives for managing and distributing/persisting sessions.
Choosing the best alternative is an important consideration for every application as is the correct configuration to achieve optimum performance.
