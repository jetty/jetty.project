==== The Base Session Module

The `sessions` module is the base module that all other session modules depend upon.
As such it will be _transitively_ enabled if you enable any of the other session modules: you need to _explicitly_ enable it if you wish to _change_ any settings from their defaults.

Enabling the `sessions` module puts the `$JETTY_HOME/etc/sessions/id-manager.xml` file onto the execution path and generates a `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/sessions.ini` file.

The `id-manager.xml` file instantiates a `DefaultSessionIdManager` and `HouseKeeper`.
The former is used to generate and manage session ids whilst the latter is responsible for periodic xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenging] of expired sessions.

===== Configuration

The `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/sessions.ini` file contains these configuration properties:

jetty.sessionIdManager.workerName::
This uniquely identifies the jetty server instance and is applied to the `SessionIdManager`.
You can either provide a value for this property, or you can allow Jetty to try and synthesize a `workerName` - the latter option is _only_ advisable in the case of a single, non-clustered deployment.
There are two ways a default `workerName` can be synthesized:

* if running on Google AppEngine, the `workerName` will be formed by concatenating the values of the environment variables `JETTY_WORKER_INSTANCE` and `GAE_INSTANCE`
* otherwise, the `workerName` will be formed by concatenating the environment variable `JETTY_WORKER_INSTANCE` and the literal `0`.

So, if you're not running on Google AppEngine, and you haven't configured one, the workerName will always be: `node0`.

IMPORTANT: If you have more than one Jetty instance, it is *crucial* that you configure the `workerName` differently for each instance. 

jetty.sessionScavengeInterval.seconds::
This is the period in _seconds_ between runs of the `HouseKeeper`, responsible for orchestrating the removal of expired sessions.
By default it will run approximately every 600 secs (ie 10 mins).
As a rule of thumb, you should ensure that the xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenge] interval is shorter than the `<session-timeout>` of your sessions to ensure that they are promptly scavenged.
On the other hand, if you have a backend store configured for your sessions, xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenging] too frequently can increase the load on it.

CAUTION: Don't forget that the `<session-timeout>` is specified in `web.xml` in _minutes_ and the value of the `jetty.sessionScavengeInterval.seconds` is in _seconds_.

===== Session Scavenging

The `HouseKeeper` is responsible for the periodic initiation of session scavenge cycles.
The `jetty.sessionScavengeInterval.seconds` property in `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/sessions.ini` controls the periodicity of the cycle.

[NOTE]
====
The HouseKeeper semi-randomly adds an additional 10% to the configured `sessionScavengeInterval`.
This is to prevent multiple nodes in a cluster that are all started at once from syncing up scavenge cycles and placing extra load on the configured persistence mechanism.
====

A session whose expiry time has been exceeded is considered eligible for scavenging.
The session might be present in a `SessionCache` and/or present in the session persistence/clustering mechanism.

Scavenging occurs for all contexts on a server at every cycle.
The `HouseKeeper` sequentially asks the `SessionHandler` in each context to find and remove expired sessions.
The `SessionHandler` works with the `SessionDataStore` to evaluate candidates for expiry held in the `SessionCache`, and also to sweep the persistence mechanism to find expired sessions.

The sweep takes two forms: once per cycle the `SessionDataStore` searches for sessions for its own context that have expired; infrequently, the `SessionDataStore` will widen the search to expired sessions in all contexts.
The former finds sessions that are no longer in this context's `SessionCache`, and using some heuristics, are unlikely to be in the `SessionCache` of the same context on another node either.
These sessions will be loaded and fully expired, meaning that `HttpSessionListener.destroy()` will be called for them.
The latter finds sessions that have not been disposed of by scavenge cycles on any other context/node.
As these will be sessions that expired a long time ago, and may not be appropriate to load by the context doing the scavenging, these are summarily deleted without `HttpSessionListener.destroy()` being called.

A combination of these sweeps should ensure that the persistence mechanism does not fill over time with expired sessions.

As aforementioned, the sweep period needs to be short enough to find expired sessions in a timely fashion, but not so often that it overloads the persistence mechanism.
