[[og-session-cache]]
==== Modules for HTTP Session Caching

In this section we will look at the alternatives for the `SessionCache`, i.e. the L1 cache of in-use session objects.
Jetty ships with 2 alternatives: an in-memory cache, and a null cache.
The latter does not actually do any caching of sessions, and can be useful if you either want to minimize your support for sessions, or you are in a clustered deployment without a sticky loadbalancer.

The xref:og-session-usecases[scenarios] go into more detail on this.

[[og-session-cache-hash]]
===== Caching in Memory

If you wish to change any of the default configuration values you should enable the `session-cache-hash` xref:startup-modules[module].
The name `"hash"` harks back to historical Jetty session implementations, whereby sessions were kept in memory using a HashMap.

====== Configuration

The `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/session-cache-hash.ini` contains the following configurable properties:

jetty.session.evictionPolicy::
Integer, default -1.
This controls whether session objects that are held in memory are subject to eviction from the cache.
Eviction means that the session is removed from the cache.
This can reduce the memory footprint of the cache and can be useful if you have a lot of sessions.
Eviction is usually used in conjunction with a `SessionDataStore` that persists sessions.
The eviction strategies and their corresponding values are:
   -1 (NO EVICTION):::
   sessions are never evicted from the cache.
   The only way they leave are via expiration or invalidation.
   0 (EVICT AFTER USE):::
   sessions are evicted from the cache as soon as the last active request for it finishes.
   The session will be passed to the `SessionDataStore` to be written out before eviction.
   >= 1 (EVICT ON INACTIVITY):::
   any positive number is the time in seconds after which a session that is in the cache but has not experienced any activity will be evicted.
   Use the `jetty.session.saveOnInactiveEvict` property to force a session write before eviction.

NOTE: If you are not using one of the session store modules, ie one of the ``session-store-xxxx``s, then sessions will be lost when the context is stopped, or the session is evicted.

jetty.session.saveOnInactiveEvict::
Boolean, default `false`.
This controls whether a session will be persisted to the `SessionDataStore` if it is being evicted due to the EVICT ON INACTIVITY policy.
Usually sessions will be written to the `SessionDataStore` whenever the last simultaneous request exits the session.
However, as `SessionDataStores` can be configured to skip some writes (see the documentation for the `session-store-xxx` module that you are using), this option is provided to ensure that the session will be written out.

NOTE: Be careful with this option, as in clustered scenarios it would be possible to "re-animate" a session that has actually been deleted by another node.

jetty.session.saveOnCreate::
Boolean, default `false`.
Controls whether a session that is newly created will be immediately saved to the `SessionDataStore` or lazily saved as the last request for the session exits.
This can be useful if the request dispatches to another context and needs to re-use the same session id.

jetty.session.removeUnloadableSessions::
Boolean, default `false`.
Controls whether the session cache should ask a `SessionDataStore` to delete a session that cannot be restored - for example because it is corrupted.

jetty.session.flushOnResponseCommit::
Boolean, default `false`.
If true, if a session is "dirty" - ie its attributes have changed - it will be written to the `SessionDataStore` as the response is about to commit.
This ensures that all subsequent requests whether to the same or different node will see the updated session data.
If false, a dirty session will only be written to the backing store when the last simultaneous request for it leaves the session.

jetty.session.invalidateOnShutdown::
Boolean, default `false`.
If true, when a context is shutdown, all sessions in the cache are invalidated and deleted both from the cache and from the `SessionDataStore`.

[[og-session-cache-null]]
===== No Caching

You may need to use the `session-cache-null` module if your clustering setup does not have a sticky load balancer, or if you want absolutely minimal support for sessions.
If you enable this module, but you don't enable a module that provides session persistence (ie one of the `session-store-xxx` modules), then sessions will _neither_ be retained in memory _nor_ persisted.

====== Configuration

The `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/session-cache-null.ini` contains the following configurable properties:

jetty.session.saveOnCreate::
Boolean, default `false`.
Controls whether a session that is newly created will be immediately saved to the `SessionDataStore` or lazily saved as the last request for the session exits.
This can be useful if the request dispatches to another context and needs to re-use the same session id.

jetty.session.removeUnloadableSessions::
Boolean, default `false`.
Controls whether the session cache should ask a `SessionDataStore` to delete a session that cannot be restored - for example because it is corrupted.

jetty.session.flushOnResponseCommit::
Boolean, default `false`.
If true, if a session is "dirty" - ie its attributes have changed - it will be written to the backing store as the response is about to commit.
This ensures that all subsequent requests whether to the same or different node will see the updated session data.
If false, a dirty session will only be written to the backing store when the last simultaneous request for it leaves the session.
