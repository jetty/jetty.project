==== Modules for Persistent HTTP Sessions: Google Cloud DataStore

Jetty can store http session information into GCloud by enabling the `session-store-gcloud` module.

===== Preparation

You will first need to create a project and enable the Google Cloud api: link:https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#preparation[].
Take note of the project id that you create in this step as you need to supply it in later steps.

===== Communicating with GCloudDataStore

====== When Running Jetty Outside of Google Infrastructure

Before running Jetty, you will need to choose one of the following methods to set up the local environment to enable remote GCloud DataStore communications.

1. Using the GCloud SDK:
  * Ensure you have the GCloud SDK installed: link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/?hl=en[]
  * Use the GCloud tool to set up the project you created in the preparation step: `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`
  * Use the GCloud tool to authenticate a google account associated with the project created in the preparation step: `gcloud auth login ACCOUNT`

2. Using environment variables
  * Define the environment variable `GCLOUD_PROJECT` with the project id you created in the preparation step.
  * Generate a JSON link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication?hl=en#service_accounts[service account key] and then define the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/my/key.json`

====== When Running Jetty Inside of Google Infrastructure

The Google deployment tools will automatically configure the project and authentication information for you.

===== Configuring Indexes for Session Data

Using some special, composite indexes can speed up session search operations, although it may make write operations slower.
By default, indexes will _not_ be used.
In order to use them, you will need to manually upload a file that defines the indexes.
This file is named `index.yaml` and you can find it in your distribution in `$JETTY_BASE/etc/sessions/gcloud/index.yaml`.

Follow the instructions link:https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/#the_development_workflow_using_gcloud[here] to upload the pre-generated `index.yaml` file.

===== Communicating with the GCloudDataStore Emulator

To enable communication using the GCloud Emulator:

* Ensure you have the GCloud SDK installed: link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/?hl=en[]
* Follow the instructions link:https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/tools/datastore-emulator[here] on how to start the GCloud datastore emulator, and how to propagate the environment variables that it creates to the terminal in which you run Jetty.

===== Enabling the Google Cloud DataStore Module

The `session-store-gcloud` module provides GCloud support for storing session data.

Because the Google Cloud DataStore is not a technology provided by the Eclipse Foundation, when enabling the module you will be prompted to assent to the licenses of the external vendor.

As GCloud requires certain Java Commons Logging features to work correctly, Jetty routes these through SLF4J.
By default Jetty implements the SLF4J api, but you can choose a different logging implementation by following the instructions xref:og-server-logging[here]

IMPORTANT: If you want to use updated versions of the jar files automatically downloaded during the module enablement, you can place them in the associated `$JETTY_BASE/lib/` directory and use the `--skip-file-validation=<module name>` command line option to prevent errors when starting your server.

==== Configuration

The `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/session-store-gcloud.ini` file contains all of the configurable properties for the `session-store-gcloud` module:

jetty.session.gcloud.maxRetries::
Integer.
Default 5.
Maximum number of retries to connect to GCloud DataStore to write a session.

jetty.session.gcloud.backoffMs::
Integer in milliseconds.
Default 1000.
Number of milliseconds between successive attempts to connect to the GCloud DataStore to write a session.

jetty.session.gracePeriod.seconds::
Integer, in seconds.
Default 3600.
Used during session xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenging].
Multiples of this period are used to define how long ago a stored session must have expired before it should be xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenged].

jetty.session.savePeriod.seconds::
Integer, in seconds, default is `0`.
Whenever a session is accessed by a request, its `lastAccessTime` and `expiry` are updated.
Even if your sessions are read-mostly, the `lastAccessTime` and  `expiry` will always change.
For heavily-used, read-mostly sessions you can save some time by skipping some writes for sessions for which only these fields have changed (ie no session attributes changed).
The value of this property is used to skip writes for these kinds of sessions: the session will only be written out if the time since the last write exceeds the value of this property.

[WARNING]
====
You should be careful in the use of this property in clustered environments: if you set too large a value for this property, the session may not be written out sufficiently often to update its `expiry` time thus making it appear to other nodes that it has expired.
Thorough consideration of the `maxIdleTime` of the session when setting the `savePeriod` is imperative - it would be undesirable to set a `savePeriod` that is larger than the `maxIdleTime`.
====

jetty.session.gcloud.namespace::
Optional.
Sets the namespace for GCloud Datastore to use.
If set, partitions the visibility of session data between webapps, which is helpful for multi-tenant deployments.
More information can be found link:https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/multitenancy[here.]

Configuration of the stored session object and its fields names-::
You should very rarely, if ever, need to change these defaults.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.kind:::
The default is "GCloudSession".
This is the type of the object that is stored in GCloud.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.id:::
The default is "id".
This is the session id.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.contextPath:::
The default is "contextPath".
This is the canonicalized context path of the context to which the session belongs.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.vhost:::
The default is "vhost".
This is the canonicalized virtual host of the context to which the session belongs.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.accessed:::
The default is "accessed".
This is the current access time of the session.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.lastAccessed:::
The default is "lastAccessed".
This is the last access time of the session.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.createTime:::
The default is "createTime".
This is the time, in ms since the epoch, at which the session was created.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.cookieSetTime:::
The default is "cookieSetTime".
This is the time at which the session cookie was last set.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.lastNode:::
The default is "lastNode".
This is the `workerName` of the last node to manage the session.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.expiry:::
The default is "expiry".
This is the time, in ms since the epoch, at which the session will expire.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.maxInactive:::
The default is "maxInactive".
This is the session timeout in ms.
jetty.session.gcloud.model.attributes:::
The default is "attributes".
This is a map of all the session attributes.
