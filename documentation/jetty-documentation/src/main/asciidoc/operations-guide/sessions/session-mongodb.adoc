[[og-session-mongo]]
==== Modules for Persistent HTTP Sessions: MongoDB

Enabling the `session-store-mongo` module configures Jetty to store session data in MongoDB.

Because MongoDB is not a technology provided by the Eclipse Foundation, you will be prompted to assent to the licenses of the external vendor (Apache in this case) during the install.
Jars needed by MongoDB are downloaded and stored into a directory named `$JETTY_BASE/lib/nosql/`.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use updated versions of the jar files automatically downloaded by Jetty, you can place them in the associated `$JETTY_BASE/lib/` directory and use the `--skip-create-files=<module name>` command line option to prevent errors when starting your server.

===== Configuration

The `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/session-store-mongo.ini` file contains these configurable properties:

jetty.session.mongo.dbName::
Default is "HttpSessions".
This is the name of the database in MongoDB used to store the session collection.

jetty.session.mongo.collectionName::
Default is "jettySessions".
This is the name of the collection in MongoDB used to store all of the sessions.

The connection type-::
You can connect to MongoDB either using a host/port combination, or a URI.
By default, the host/port method is selected, but you can change this by commenting out the unwanted method, and uncommenting the other one.
connection-type=address:::
Used when utilizing a direct connection to the MongoDB server.
jetty.session.mongo.host::::
Host name or address for the remote MongoDB instance.
jetty.session.mongo.port::::
Port number for the remote MongoDB instance.
connection-type=uri:::
Used when utilizing MongoURI for secured connections.
jetty.session.mongo.connectionString::::
The string defining the MongoURI value, such as `+mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]][/[database][?options]]+`.
More information on how to format the MongoURI string can be found in the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/[official documentation for mongo].
[NOTE]
====
You will only use *one* `connection-type` at a time, either `address` or `uri`.
If both are utilized in your `session-store-mongo.ini`, only the _last_ `connection-type` configured in the file will be used.
====

jetty.session.gracePeriod.seconds::
Integer, in seconds.
Default 3600.
Used during session xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenging].
Multiples of this period are used to define how long ago a stored session must have expired before it should be xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenged].

jetty.session.savePeriod.seconds::
Integer, in seconds, default is `0`.
Whenever a session is accessed by a request, its `lastAccessTime` and `expiry` are updated.
Even if your sessions are read-mostly, the `lastAccessTime` and  `expiry` will always change.
For heavily-used, read-mostly sessions you can save some time by skipping some writes for sessions for which only these fields have changed (ie no session attributes changed).
The value of this property is used to skip writes for these kinds of sessions: the session will only be written out if the time since the last write exceeds the value of this property.

[WARNING]
====
You should be careful in the use of this property in clustered environments: if you set too large a value for this property, the session may not be written out sufficiently often to update its `expiry` time thus making it appear to other nodes that it has expired.
Thorough consideration of the `maxIdleTime` of the session when setting the `savePeriod` is imperative - it would be undesirable to set a `savePeriod` that is larger than the `maxIdleTime`.
