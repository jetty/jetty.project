==== HTTP Session Overview

===== Terminology

Before diving into the specifics of how to plug-in and configure various alternative HTTP session management modules, let's review some useful terminology:

Session::
is a means of retaining information across requests for a particular user.
The Servlet Specification defines the semantics of sessions.
Some of the most important characteristics of sessions is that they have a unique id and that their contents cannot be shared between different contexts (although the id can be): if a session is invalidated in one context, then all other sessions that share the same id in other contexts will also be invalidated.
Sessions can expire or they can be explicitly invalidated.

SessionIdManager::
is responsible for allocating session ids.
A Jetty server can have at most 1 SessionIdManager.

HouseKeeper::
is responsible for periodically orchestrating the removal of expired sessions.
This process is referred to as xref:og-session-base-scavenge["scavenging"].

SessionHandler::
is responsible for managing the lifecycle of sessions.
A context can have at most 1 `SessionHandler`.

SessionCache::
is a L1 cache of in-use session objects.
The `SessionCache` is used by the `SessionHandler`.

SessionDataStore::
is responsible for all clustering/persistence operations on sessions.
A `SessionCache` uses a `SessionDataStore` as a backing store.

CachingSessionDataStore::
is an L2 cache of session data.
A `SessionCache` can use a `CachingSessionDataStore` as its backing store.

More details on these concepts can be found in the xref:{prog-guide}#pg-server-session[Programming Guide].

[NOTE]
====
``SessionDataStore``s implementations interact with other, usually third party, systems responsible for storing and/or distributing session information.
Sessions can be distributed without being persisted.
They can also be persisted without being distributed.
Because persisting session information to a shared store is a very common way of distributing (also known as "clustering") sessions, in the documentation we will often refer to just "persisting".

[[og-session-modules]]
===== Session Modules

There are a number of modules that offer pluggable alternatives for http session management.
You can design how you want to cache and store http sessions by selecting alternative combinations of session modules.

For example, Jetty ships with two alternative implementations of the `SessionCache`:

* one that caches sessions in memory: xref:og-session-cache-hash[`session-cache-hash`]
* one that does not actually cache: xref:og-session-cache-null[`session-cache-null`]

There are at least 6 alternative implementations of the `SessionDataStore` that you can use to persist/distribute your http sessions:

* file system storage: xref:og-session-filesystem[`session-store-file`]
* relational database storage: xref:og-session-jdbc[`session-store-jdbc`]
* NoSQL database storage: xref:og-session-mongo[`session-store-mongo`]
* Google Cloud datastore storage: xref:og-session-gcloud[`session-store-gcloud`]
* Hazelcast: xref:og-session-hazelcast-remote[`session-store-hazelcast-remote`] or xref:og-session-hazelcast-embedded[`session-store-hazelcast-embedded`]
* Infinispan: xref:og-session-infinispan[`session-store-infinispan-remote`] or xref:og-session-infinispan-embedded[`session-store-infinispan-embedded`]

TIP: It is worth noting that if you do not configure _any_ session modules, Jetty will still provide HTTP sessions that are cached in memory but are never persisted.
