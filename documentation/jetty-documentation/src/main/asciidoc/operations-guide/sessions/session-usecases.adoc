==== Session Scenarios

===== Minimizing Support for Sessions

The standard support for webapps in Jetty will use sessions cached in memory, but not persisted/clustered, with a scavenge for expired sessions that occurs every 10 minutes.
If you wish to pare back support for sessions because you know your app doesn't use them (or use JSPs that use them), then you can do the following:

* enable the xref:og-session-base[base sessions module] and xref:og-session-base[configure the scavenge interval] to 0 to prevent scavenging
* enable the xref:og-session-cache-null[null session cache module] to prevent sessions being cached in memory

If you wish to do any further minimization, you should consult the xref:{prog-guide}#pg-server-session[Programming Guide].

===== Clustering with a Sticky Load Balancer

Preferably, your cluster will utilize a sticky load balancer.
This will route requests for the same session to the same Jetty instance.
In this case, the xref:og-session-cache-hash[`DefaultSessionCache`] can be used to keep in-use session objects xref:og-session-cache-hash[in memory].
You can fine-tune the cache by controlling how long session objects remain in memory with the xref:og-session-cache-hash[eviction policy settings].

If you have a large number of sessions or very large session objects, then you may want to manage your memory allocation by controlling the amount of time session objects spend in the cache.
The `EVICT_ON_SESSION_EXIT` eviction policy will remove a session object from the cache as soon as the last simultaneous request referencing it exits.
Alternatively, the `EVICT_ON_INACTIVITY` policy will remove a session object from the cache after a configurable amount of time has passed without a request referencing it.

If your sessions are very long lived and infrequently referenced, you might use the `EVICT_ON_INACTIVITY_POLICY` to control the size of the cache.

If your sessions are small, or relatively few or stable in number or they are read-mostly, then you might select the `NEVER_EVICT` policy.
With this policy, session objects will remain in the cache until they either expire or are explicitly invalidated.

If you have a high likelihood of simultaneous requests for the same session object, then the `EVICT_ON_SESSION_EXIT` policy will ensure the session object stays in the cache as long as it is needed.

===== Clustering Without a Sticky Load Balancer

Without a sticky load balancer requests for the same session may arrive on any node in the cluster.
This means it is likely that the copy of the session object in any `SessionCache` is likely to be out-of-date, as the session was probably last accessed on a different node.
In this case, your choices are to use either the xref:og-session-cache-null[`NullSessionCache`] or to de-tune the xref:og-session-cache-hash[`DefaultSessionCache`].
If you use the `NullSessionCache` all session object caching is avoided.
This means that every time a request references a session it must be read in from persistent storage.
It also means that there can be no sharing of session objects for multiple requests for the same session: each will have their own independent session object.
Furthermore, the outcome of session writes are indeterminate because the Servlet Specification does not mandate ACID transactions for sessions.

If you use the `DefaultSessionCache`, there is a risk that the caches on some nodes will contain out-of-date session information as simultaneous requests for the same session are scattered over the cluster.
To mitigate this somewhat you can use the `EVICT_ON_SESSION_EXIT` eviction policy: this will ensure that the session is removed from the cache as soon as the last simultaneous request for it exits.
Again, due to the lack of session transactionality, the ordering outcome of write operations cannot be guaranteed.
As the session is cached while at least one request is accessing it, it is possible for multiple simultaneous requests to share the same session object.

===== Handling Corrupted or Unreadable Session Data

For various reasons it might not be possible for the `SessionDataStore` to re-read a stored session.
One scenario is that the session stores a serialized object in its attributes, and after a re-deployment there in an incompatible class change.
Setting the `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/session-cache-hash.ini` or `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/session-cache-null.ini` property `jetty.session.removeUnloadableSessions` to `true` will allow the unreadable session to be removed from persistent storage.
This can be useful for preventing the xref:og-session-base-scavenge[scavenger] from continually generating errors on the same expired, but un-readable session.
