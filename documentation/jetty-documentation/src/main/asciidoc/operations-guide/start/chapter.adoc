=== Jetty Start Mechanism

NOTE: Make sure you have read the xref:og-arch[Jetty architecture section] if you are not familiar with the terms used in this section.

The Jetty start mechanism is invoked by executing `$JETTY_HOME/start.jar`, from within a `$JETTY_BASE` directory, with zero or more command line options:

----
$ cd $JETTY_BASE
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar ...
----

The Jetty start mechanism has two main modes of operation:

* The _tool_ mode, detailed in xref:og-start-configure[this section], when it is used as a command line tool to configure the `$JETTY_BASE` directory by enabling modules, creating sub-directories and files, downloading files, etc.
In this mode, the JVM started with `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar` performs the specified command and then exits.
* The _start_ mode, detailed in xref:og-start-start[this section], when it is used to start the JVM that runs Jetty with the specified configuration.
In this mode, the JVM started with `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar` starts Jetty and does not exit until stopped, for example by hitting kbd:[Ctrl+C] on the terminal.

Refer to the xref:og-start-reference[Jetty start mechanism reference section] for the complete list of the available command line options.

You want to use the Jetty start mechanism to xref:og-start-configure[configure your $JETTY_BASE] and then to xref:og-start-start[start Jetty].

==== Start Mechanism Logging

The steps performed by the Jetty start mechanism are logged by the `StartLog` class, that outputs directly, by default, to `System.err`.

This is necessary to avoid that the Jetty start mechanism depend on logging libraries that may clash with those defined by Jetty logging modules, when Jetty is started in-VM.

[NOTE]
====
This section is about the logging performed by the Jetty start mechanism _before_ it configures and starts Jetty.
See the xref:og-logging[logging section] for information about logging when Jetty starts.
====

You can enable DEBUG level logging with the `--debug` command line option, for both the _tool_ and _start_ modes:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --debug ...
----

You can send the start log output to a file, by default relative to `$JETTY_BASE`, with the `--start-log-file=<file>` option:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --debug --start-log-file=start.log ...
----

This is useful for capturing startup issues where the Jetty-specific logger has not yet kicked in due to a possible startup configuration error.
