=== Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot Jetty when used as a production server, there are two main tools: the Jetty Server Dump and enabling DEBUG level logging.

Jetty is based on components organized as a tree, with the `Server` instance at the root of the tree.

As explained in the xref:og-jmx[JMX section], these components can be exported as JMX MBeans and therefore be accessible from JMX Consoles such as Java Missions Control (JMC).

Being able to take a snapshot of the state of Jetty while it is running is the most useful information that can be attached when reporting an issue.
Such state includes:

* The thread pool configuration and its current state, including how many threads are in use, and their stack trace.
* The TLS configuration.
* The I/O configuration and its current state, including the ports Jetty listens to, how many connections are currently open, and he state of each connection, and the state of the request/response handling for each connection.
* The `Handler` structure and its configuration.
* The web applications deployed and their configurations, including the class loader information.

The prerequisite for troubleshooting is to enable JMX, so that Jetty -- possibly a production server -- can be accessed from a remote location to obtain the information exported via JMX, and possibly be able to reconfigure Jetty to solve the issue.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you read about how to secure the access to Jetty when using xref:og-jmx-remote[remote JMX].
