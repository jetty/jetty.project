=== Jetty I/O Architecture

Jetty libraries (both client and server) use Java NIO to handle I/O, so that at its core Jetty I/O is completely non-blocking.

[[pg-arch-io-selector-manager]]
==== Jetty I/O: `SelectorManager`

The core class of Jetty I/O is link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager.html[`SelectorManager`].

`SelectorManager` manages internally a configurable number of link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/ManagedSelector.html[`ManagedSelector`]s.
Each `ManagedSelector` wraps an instance of `java.nio.channels.Selector` that in turn manages a number of `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel` instances.

NOTE: TODO: add image

`SocketChannel` instances can be created by clients when connecting to a server and by a server when accepting connections from clients.
In both cases the `SocketChannel` instance is passed to `SelectorManager` (which passes it to `ManagedSelector` and eventually to `java.nio.channels.Selector`) to be registered for use within Jetty.

It is possible for an application to create the `SocketChannel` instances outside Jetty, even perform some initial network traffic also outside Jetty (for example for authentication purposes), and then pass the `SocketChannel` instance to `SelectorManager` for use within Jetty.

This example shows how a client can connect to a server:

[[pg-arch-io-endpoint-connection]]
==== Jetty I/O: `EndPoint` and `Connection`

``SocketChannel``s that are passed to `SelectorManager` are wrapped into two related components: an link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/EndPoint.html[`EndPoint`] and a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/Connection.html[`Connection`].

`EndPoint` is the Jetty abstraction for a `SocketChannel`: you can read bytes from an `EndPoint` via `EndPoint.fill(ByteBuffer)`, you can write bytes to an `EndPoint` via `EndPoint.flush(ByteBuffer\...)` and `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer\...)`, you can close an `EndPoint` via `EndPoint.close()`, etc.

`Connection` is the Jetty abstraction that is responsible to read bytes from the `EndPoint` and to deserialize the read bytes into objects.
For example, an HTTP/1.1 server-side `Connection` implementation is responsible to deserialize HTTP/1.1 request bytes into an HTTP request object.
Conversely, an HTTP/1.1 client-side `Connection` implementation is responsible to deserialize HTTP/1.1 response bytes into an HTTP response object.

`Connection` is the abstraction that implements the reading side of a specific protocol such as HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/2, or WebSocket: it is able to read incoming communication in that protocol.

The writing side for a specific protocol _may_ be implemented in the `Connection` but may also be implemented in other components, although eventually the bytes to be written will be written through the `EndPoint`.

While there is primarily just one implementation of `EndPoint`,link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SocketChannelEndPoint.html[`SocketChannelEndPoint`] (used both on the client-side and on the server-side), there are many implementations of `Connection`, typically two for each protocol (one for the client-side and one for the server-side).

The `EndPoint` and `Connection` pairs can be chained, for example in case of encrypted communication using the TLS protocol.
There is an `EndPoint` and `Connection` TLS pair where the `EndPoint` reads the encrypted bytes from the socket and the `Connection` decrypts them; next in the chain there is an `EndPoint` and `Connection` pair where the `EndPoint` "reads" decrypted bytes (provided by the previous `Connection`) and the `Connection` deserializes them into specific protocol objects (for example HTTP/2 frame objects).

Certain protocols, such as WebSocket, start the communication with the server using one protocol (for example, HTTP/1.1), but then change the communication to use another protocol (for example, WebSocket).
`EndPoint` supports changing the `Connection` object on-the-fly via `EndPoint.upgrade(Connection)`.
This allows to use the HTTP/1.1 `Connection` during the initial communication and later to replace it with a WebSocket `Connection`.

NOTE: TODO: add a section on `UpgradeFrom` and `UpgradeTo`?

`SelectorManager` is an abstract class because while it knows how to create concrete `EndPoint` instances, it does not know how to create protocol specific `Connection` instances.

Creating `Connection` instances is performed on the server-side by link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ConnectionFactory.html[`ConnectionFactory`]s and on the client-side by link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/ClientConnectionFactory.html[`ClientConnectionFactory`]s

On the server-side, the component that aggregates a `SelectorManager` with a set of ``ConnectionFactory``s is link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ServerConnector.html[`ServerConnector`]s for TCP/IP sockets, and link:{JDURL}/org/eclipse/jetty/unixdomain/server/UnixDomainServerConnector.html[`UnixDomainServerConnector`] for Unix-Domain sockets (see the xref:pg-server-io-arch[server-side architecture section] for more information).

On the client-side, the components that aggregates a `SelectorManager` with a set of ``ClientConnectionFactory``s are link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/client/HttpClientTransport.html[`HttpClientTransport`] subclasses (see the xref:pg-client-io-arch[client-side architecture section] for more information).

[[pg-arch-io-endpoint]]
==== Jetty I/O: `EndPoint`

The Jetty I/O library use Java NIO to handle I/O, so that I/O is non-blocking.

At the Java NIO level, in order to be notified when a `SocketChannel` has data to be read, the `SelectionKey.OP_READ` flag must be set.

In the Jetty I/O library, you can call `EndPoint.fillInterested(Callback)` to declare interest in the "read" (also called "fill") event, and the `Callback` parameter is the object that is notified when such an event occurs.

At the Java NIO level, a `SocketChannel` is always writable, unless it becomes TCP congested.
In order to be notified when a `SocketChannel` uncongests and it is therefore writable again, the `SelectionKey.OP_WRITE` flag must be set.

In the Jetty I/O library, you can call `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` to write the ``ByteBuffer``s and the `Callback` parameter is the object that is notified when the whole write is finished (i.e. _all_ ``ByteBuffer``s have been fully written, even if they are delayed by TCP congestion/uncongestion).

The `EndPoint` APIs abstract out the Java NIO details by providing non-blocking APIs based on `Callback` objects for I/O operations.
The `EndPoint` APIs are typically called by `Connection` implementations, see xref:pg-arch-io-connection[this section].

[[pg-arch-io-connection]]
==== Jetty I/O: `Connection`

`Connection` is the abstraction that deserializes incoming bytes into objects, for example an HTTP request object or a WebSocket frame object, that can be used by more abstract layers.

`Connection` instances have two lifecycle methods:

* `Connection.onOpen()`, invoked when the `Connection` is associated with the `EndPoint`
* `Connection.onClose(Throwable)`, invoked when the `Connection` is disassociated from the `EndPoint`, where the `Throwable` parameter indicates whether the disassociation was normal (when the parameter is `null`) or was due to an error (when the parameter is not `null`)

When a `Connection` is first created, it is not registered for any Java NIO event.
It is therefore typical to implement `onOpen()` to call `EndPoint.fillInterested(Callback)` so that the `Connection` declares interest for read events and it is invoked (via the `Callback`) when the read event happens.

Abstract class `AbstractConnection` partially implements `Connection` and provides simpler APIs.
The example below shows a typical implementation that extends `AbstractConnection`:

===== Jetty I/O: `Connection.Listener`

TODO

[[pg-arch-io-echo]]
==== Jetty I/O: Network Echo

With the concepts above it is now possible to write a simple, fully non-blocking, `Connection` implementation that simply echoes the bytes that it reads back to the other peer.

A naive, but wrong, implementation may be the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/SelectorManagerDocs.java[tags=echo-wrong]
----

WARNING: The implementation above is wrong and leads to `StackOverflowError`.

The problem with this implementation is that if the writes always complete synchronously (i.e. without being delayed by TCP congestion), you end up with this sequence of calls:

----
Connection.onFillable()
  EndPoint.write()
    Connection.succeeded()
      Connection.onFillable()
        EndPoint.write()
          Connection.succeeded()
          ...
----

which leads to `StackOverflowError`.

This is a typical side effect of asynchronous programming using non-blocking APIs, and happens in the Jetty I/O library as well.

NOTE: The callback is invoked synchronously for efficiency reasons.
Submitting the invocation of the callback to an `Executor` to be invoked in a different thread would cause a context switch and make simple writes extremely inefficient.

This side effect of asynchronous programming leading to `StackOverflowError` is so common that the Jetty libraries have a generic solution for it: a specialized `Callback` implementation named `org.eclipse.jetty.util.IteratingCallback` that turns recursion into iteration, therefore avoiding the `StackOverflowError`.

`IteratingCallback` is a `Callback` implementation that should be passed to non-blocking APIs such as `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` when they are performed in a loop.

`IteratingCallback` works by starting the loop with `IteratingCallback.iterate()`.
In turn, this calls `IteratingCallback.process()`, an abstract method that must be implemented with the code that should be executed for each loop.

Method `process()` must return:

* `Action.SCHEDULED`, to indicate whether the loop has performed a non-blocking, possibly asynchronous, operation
* `Action.IDLE`, to indicate that the loop should temporarily be suspended to be resumed later
* `Action.SUCCEEDED` to indicate that the loop exited successfully

Any exception thrown within `process()` exits the loops with a failure.

Now that you know how `IteratingCallback` works, a correct implementation for the echo `Connection` is the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/SelectorManagerDocs.java[tags=echo-correct]
----

When `onFillable()` is called, for example the first time that bytes are available from the network, the iteration is started.
Starting the iteration calls `process()`, where a buffer is allocated and filled with bytes read from the network via `EndPoint.fill(ByteBuffer)`; the buffer is subsequently written back via `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` -- note that the callback passed to `EndPoint.write()` is `this`, i.e. the `IteratingCallback` itself; finally `Action.SCHEDULED` is returned, returning from the `process()` method.

At this point, the call to `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` may have completed synchronously; `IteratingCallback` would know that and call `process()` again; within `process()`, the buffer has already been allocated so it will be reused, saving further allocations; the buffer will be filled and possibly written again; `Action.SCHEDULED` is returned again, returning again from the `process()` method.

At this point, the call to `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` may have not completed synchronously, so `IteratingCallback` will not call `process()` again; the processing thread is free to return to the Jetty I/O system where it may be put back into the thread pool.
If this was the only active network connection, the system would now be idle, with no threads blocked, waiting that the `write()` completes. This thread-less wait is one of the most important features that make non-blocking asynchronous servers more scalable: they use less resources.

Eventually, the Jetty I/O system will notify that the `write()` completed; this notifies the `IteratingCallback` that can now resume the loop and call `process()` again.

When `process()` is called, it is possible that zero bytes are read from the network; in this case, you want to deallocate the buffer since the other peer may never send more bytes for the `Connection` to read, or it may send them after a long pause -- in both cases we do not want to retain the memory allocated by the buffer; next, you want to call `fillInterested()` to declare again interest for read events, and return `Action.IDLE` since there is nothing to write back and therefore the loop may be suspended.
When more bytes are again available to be read from the network, `onFillable()` will be called again and that will start the iteration again.

Another possibility is that during `process()` the read returns `-1` indicating that the other peer has closed the connection; this means that there will not be more bytes to read and the loop can be exited, so you return `Action.SUCCEEDED`; `IteratingCallback` will then call `onCompleteSuccess()` where you can close the `EndPoint`.

The last case is that during `process()` an exception is thrown, for example by `EndPoint.fill(ByteBuffer)` or, in more advanced implementations, by code that parses the bytes that have been read and finds them unacceptable; any exception thrown within `process()` will be caught by `IteratingCallback` that will exit the loop with a failure and call `onCompleteFailure(Throwable)` with the exception that has been thrown, where you can close the `EndPoint`, passing the exception that is the reason for closing prematurely the `EndPoint`.

====
Asynchronous programming is hard.

Rely on the Jetty classes to implement `Connection` to avoid mistakes that will be difficult to diagnose and reproduce.
