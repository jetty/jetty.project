==== HttpClient Authentication Support

Jetty's `HttpClient` supports the `BASIC` and `DIGEST` authentication mechanisms defined by link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235[RFC 7235], as well as the SPNEGO authentication mechanism defined in link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4559[RFC 4559].

The HTTP _conversation_, the sequence of related HTTP requests, for a request that needs authentication is the following:

[plantuml]
----
skinparam backgroundColor transparent
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false

participant Application
participant HttpClient
participant Server

Application -> Server : GET /path
Server -> HttpClient : 401 + WWW-Authenticate
HttpClient -> Server : GET + Authentication
Server -> Application : 200 OK
----

Upon receiving a HTTP 401 response code, `HttpClient` looks at the `WWW-Authenticate` response header (the server _challenge_) and then tries to match configured authentication credentials to produce an `Authentication` header that contains the authentication credentials to access the resource.

You can configure authentication credentials in the `HttpClient` instance as follows:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tag=addAuthentication]
----

``Authentication``s are matched against the server challenge first by mechanism (e.g. `BASIC` or `DIGEST`), then by realm and then by URI.

If an `Authentication` match is found, the application does not receive events related to the HTTP 401 response.
These events are handled internally by `HttpClient` which produces another (internal) request similar to the original request but with an additional `Authorization` header.

If the authentication is successful, the server responds with a HTTP 200 and `HttpClient` caches the `Authentication.Result` so that subsequent requests for a matching URI will not incur in the additional rountrip caused by the HTTP 401 response.

It is possible to clear ``Authentication.Result``s in order to force authentication again:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tag=clearResults]
----

Authentication results may be preempted to avoid the additional roundtrip due to the server challenge in this way:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tag=preemptedResult]
----

In this way, requests for the given URI are enriched immediately with the `Authorization` header, and the server should respond with HTTP 200 (and the resource content) rather than with the 401 and the challenge.

It is also possible to preempt the authentication for a single request only, in this way:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tag=requestPreemptedResult]
----
