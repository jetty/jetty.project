==== HttpClient Introduction

The Jetty HTTP client module provides easy-to-use APIs and utility classes to perform HTTP (or HTTPS) requests.

Jetty's HTTP client is non-blocking and asynchronous.
It offers an asynchronous API that never blocks for I/O, making it very efficient in thread utilization and well suited for high performance scenarios such as load testing or parallel computation.

However, when all you need to do is to perform a `GET` request to a resource, Jetty's HTTP client offers also a synchronous API; a programming interface where the thread that issued the request blocks until the request/response conversation is complete.

Jetty's HTTP client supports different xref:pg-client-http-transport[transports protocols]: HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and FastCGI. This means that the semantic of an HTTP request such as: " ``GET`` the resource ``/index.html`` " can be carried over the network in different formats.
The most common and default format is HTTP/1.1. That said, Jetty's HTTP client can carry the same request using the HTTP/2 format, the HTTP/3 format, or the FastCGI format.

Furthermore, every transport protocol can be sent either over the network or via Unix-Domain sockets.
Supports for Unix-Domain sockets requires Java 16 or later, since Unix-Domain sockets support has been introduced in OpenJDK with link:https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/380[JEP 380].

The xref:pg-client-http-transport-fcgi[FastCGI transport] is heavily used in Jetty's xref:pg-server-fastcgi[FastCGI support] that allows Jetty to work as a reverse proxy to PHP (exactly like Apache or Nginx do) and therefore be able to serve, for example, WordPress websites, often in conjunction with Unix-Domain sockets (although it's possible to use FastCGI via network too).

The HTTP/2 transport allows Jetty's HTTP client to perform requests using HTTP/2 to HTTP/2 enabled web sites, see also Jetty's xref:pg-client-http2[HTTP/2 support].

The HTTP/3 transport allows Jetty's HTTP client to perform requests using HTTP/3 to HTTP/3 enabled web sites, see also Jetty's xref:pg-client-http3[HTTP/3 support].

Out of the box features that you get with the Jetty HTTP client include:

* Redirect support -- redirect codes such as 302 or 303 are automatically followed.
* Cookies support -- cookies sent by servers are stored and sent back to servers in matching requests.
* Authentication support -- HTTP "Basic", "Digest" and "SPNEGO" authentications are supported, others are pluggable.
* Forward proxy support -- HTTP proxying and SOCKS4 proxying.

[[pg-client-http-start]]
==== Starting HttpClient

The Jetty artifact that provides the main HTTP client implementation is `jetty-client`.
The Maven artifact coordinates are the following:

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-client</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The main class is named `org.eclipse.jetty.client.HttpClient`.

You can think of a `HttpClient` instance as a browser instance.
Like a browser it can make requests to different domains, it manages redirects, cookies and authentication, you can configure it with a proxy, and it provides you with the responses to the requests you make.

In order to use `HttpClient`, you must instantiate it, configure it, and then start it:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tags=start]
----

You may create multiple instances of `HttpClient`, but typically one instance is enough for an application.
There are several reasons for having multiple `HttpClient` instances including, but not limited to:

* You want to specify different configuration parameters (for example, one instance is configured with a forward proxy while another is not).
* You want the two instances to behave like two different browsers and hence have different cookies, different authentication credentials, etc.
* You want to use xref:pg-client-http-transport[different transports].

Like browsers, HTTPS requests are supported out-of-the-box (see xref:pg-client-http-configuration-tls[this section] for the TLS configuration), as long as the server provides a valid certificate.
In case the server does not provide a valid certificate (or in case it is self-signed) you want to customize ``HttpClient``'s TLS configuration as described in xref:pg-client-http-configuration-tls[this section].

[[pg-client-http-stop]]
==== Stopping HttpClient

It is recommended that when your application stops, you also stop the `HttpClient` instance (or instances) that you are using.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tags=stop]
----

Stopping `HttpClient` makes sure that the memory it holds (for example, authentication credentials, cookies, etc.) is released, and that the thread pool and scheduler are properly stopped allowing all threads used by `HttpClient` to exit.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot call `HttpClient.stop()` from one of its own threads, as it would cause a deadlock.
It is recommended that you stop `HttpClient` from an unrelated thread, or from a newly allocated thread, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tags=stopFromOtherThread]

[[pg-client-http-arch]]
==== HttpClient Architecture

A `HttpClient` instance can be thought as a browser instance, and it manages the following components:

* a `CookieStore` (see xref:pg-client-http-cookie[this section]).
* a `AuthenticationStore` (see xref:pg-client-http-authentication[this section]).
* a `ProxyConfiguration` (see xref:pg-client-http-proxy[this section]).
* a set of _destinations_.

A _destination_ is the client-side component that represents an _origin_ server, and manages a queue of requests for that origin, and a xref:pg-client-http-connection-pool[pool of TCP connections] to that origin.

An _origin_ may be simply thought as the tuple `(scheme, host, port)` and it is where the client connects to in order to communicate with the server.
However, this is not enough.

If you use `HttpClient` to write a proxy you may have different clients that want to contact the same server.
In this case, you may not want to use the same proxy-to-server connection to proxy requests for both clients, for example for authentication reasons: the server may associate the connection with authentication credentials and you do not want to use the same connection for two different users that have different credentials.
Instead, you want to use different connections for different clients and this can be achieved by "tagging" a destination with a tag object that represents the remote client (for example, it could be the remote client IP address).

Two origins with the same `(scheme, host, port)` but different `tag` create two different destinations and therefore two different connection pools.
However, also this is not enough.

It is possible for a server to speak different protocols on the same `port`.
A connection may start by speaking one protocol, for example HTTP/1.1, but then be upgraded to speak a different protocol, for example HTTP/2. After a connection has been upgraded to a second protocol, it cannot speak the first protocol anymore, so it can only be used to communicate using the second protocol.

Two origins with the same `(scheme, host, port)` but different `protocol` create two different destinations and therefore two different connection pools.

Therefore an origin is identified by the tuple `(scheme, host, port, tag, protocol)`.

[[pg-client-http-connection-pool]]
==== HttpClient Connection Pooling

A destination manages a `org.eclipse.jetty.client.ConnectionPool`, where connections to a particular origin are pooled for performance reasons:
opening a connection is a costly operation and it's better to reuse them for multiple requests.

NOTE: Remember that to select a specific destination you must select a specific origin, and that an origin is identified by the tuple `(scheme, host, port, tag, protocol)`, so you can have multiple destinations for the same `host` and `port`.

You can access the `ConnectionPool` in this way:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http/HTTPClientDocs.java[tags=getConnectionPool]
----

Jetty's client library provides the following `ConnectionPool` implementations:

* `DuplexConnectionPool`, historically the first implementation, only used by the HTTP/1.1 transport.
* `MultiplexConnectionPool`, the generic implementation valid for any transport where connections are reused with a MRU (most recently used) algorithm (that is, the connections most recently returned to the connection pool are the more likely to be used again).
* `RoundRobinConnectionPool`, similar to `MultiplexConnectionPool` but where connections are reused with a round-robin algorithm.

The `ConnectionPool` implementation can be customized for each destination in by setting a `ConnectionPool.Factory` on the `HttpClientTransport`:

----

When a request is sent, an origin is computed from the request; `HttpClient` uses that origin to find (or create if it does not exist) the correspondent destination.
The request is then queued onto the destination, and this causes the destination to ask its connection pool for a free connection.
If a connection is available, it is returned, otherwise a new connection is created.
Once the destination has obtained the connection, it dequeues the request and sends it over the connection.

The first request to a destination triggers the opening of the first connection.
A second request with the same origin sent _after_ the first request/response cycle is completed may reuse the same connection, depending on the connection pool implementation.
A second request with the same origin sent _concurrently_ with the first request will likely cause the opening of a second connection, depending on the connection pool implementation.
The configuration parameter `HttpClient.maxConnectionsPerDestination` (see also the xref:pg-client-http-configuration[configuration section]) controls the max number of connections that can be opened for a destination.

NOTE: If opening connections to a given origin takes a long time, then requests for that origin will queue up in the corresponding destination until the connections are established.

Each connection can handle a limited number of concurrent requests.
For HTTP/1.1, this number is always `1`: there can only be one outstanding request for each connection.
For HTTP/2 this number is determined by the server `max_concurrent_stream` setting (typically around `100`, i.e. there can be up to `100` outstanding requests for every connection).

When a destination has maxed out its number of connections, and all connections have maxed out their number of outstanding requests, more requests sent to that destination will be queued.
When the request queue is full, the request will be failed.
The configuration parameter `HttpClient.maxRequestsQueuedPerDestination` (see also the xref:pg-client-http-configuration[configuration section]) controls the max number of requests that can be queued for a destination.
