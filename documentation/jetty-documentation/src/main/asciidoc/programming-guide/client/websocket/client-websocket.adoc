[[pg-client-websocket]]
=== WebSocket Client

Jetty's `WebSocketClient` is a more powerful alternative to the WebSocket client provided by the standard JSR 356 `javax.websocket` APIs.

Similarly to Jetty's xref:pg-client-http[`HttpClient`], the `WebSocketClient` is non-blocking and asynchronous, making it very efficient in resource utilization.
A synchronous, blocking, API is also offered for simpler cases.

Since the first step of establishing a WebSocket communication is an HTTP request, `WebSocketClient` makes use of `HttpClient` and therefore depends on it.

The Maven artifact coordinates are the following:

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.websocket</groupId>
  <artifactId>websocket-jetty-client</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[[pg-client-websocket-start]]
==== Starting WebSocketClient

The main class is `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.client.WebSocketClient`; you instantiate it, configure it, and then start it like may other Jetty components.
This is a minimal example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/websocket/WebSocketClientDocs.java[tags=start]
----

However, it is recommended that you explicitly pass an `HttpClient` instance to `WebSocketClient` so that you can have control over the HTTP configuration as well:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/websocket/WebSocketClientDocs.java[tags=startWithHttpClient]
----

You may create multiple instances of `WebSocketClient`, but typically one instance is enough for most applications.
Creating multiple instances may be necessary for example when you need to specify different configuration parameters for different instances.
For example, you may need different instances when you need to configure the `HttpClient` differently: different transports, different proxies, different cookie stores, different authentications, etc.

WebSocket specific configuration may be typically be given a default value in `WebSocketClient` and then overridden more specifically, see for example xref:pg-websocket-session-configure[this section].

[[pg-client-websocket-stop]]
==== Stopping WebSocketClient

It is recommended that when your application stops, you also stop the `WebSocketClient` instance (or instances) that you are using.

Similarly to xref:pg-client-http-stop[stopping `HttpClient`], you want to stop `WebSocketClient` from a thread that is not owned by `WebSocketClient` itself, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/websocket/WebSocketClientDocs.java[tags=stop]
----

[[pg-client-websocket-connect]]
==== Connecting to a Remote Host

A WebSocket client may initiate the communication with the server either xref:pg-client-websocket-connect-http11[using HTTP/1.1] or xref:pg-client-websocket-connect-http2[using HTTP/2].
The two mechanism are quite different and detailed in the following sections.

[[pg-client-websocket-connect-http11]]
===== Using HTTP/1.1

Initiating a WebSocket communication with a server using HTTP/1.1 is detailed in link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.8[RFC 6455].

A WebSocket client first establishes a TCP connection to the server, then sends an HTTP/1.1 _upgrade_ request.

If the server supports upgrading to WebSocket, it responds with HTTP status code `101`, and then switches the communication over that connection, either incoming or outgoing, to happen using the WebSocket protocol.

When the client receives the HTTP status code `101`, it switches the communication over that connection, either incoming or outgoing, to happen using the WebSocket protocol.

In code:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/websocket/WebSocketClientDocs.java[tags=connectHTTP11]
----

`WebSocketClient.connect()` links the client-side WebSocket _endpoint_ to a specific server URI, and returns a `CompletableFuture` of an `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.api.Session`.

The endpoint offers APIs to _receive_ WebSocket data (or errors) from the server, while the session offers APIs to _send_ WebSocket data to the server.

[[pg-client-websocket-connect-http2]]
===== Using HTTP/2

Initiating a WebSocket communication with a server using HTTP/1.1 is detailed in link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8441[RFC 8441].

A WebSocket client establishes a TCP connection to the server or reuses an existing one currently used for HTTP/2, then sends an HTTP/2 _connect_ request over an HTTP/2 stream.

If the server supports upgrading to WebSocket, it responds with HTTP status code `200`, then switches the communication over that stream, either incoming or outgoing, to happen using HTTP/2 `DATA` frames wrapping WebSocket frames.

When the client receives the HTTP status code `200`, it switches the communication over that stream, either incoming or outgoing, to happen using HTTP/2 `DATA` frames wrapping WebSocket frames.

From an external point of view, it will look like client is sending chunks of an infinite HTTP/2 request upload, and the server is sending chunks of an infinite HTTP/2 response download, as they will exchange HTTP/2 `DATA` frames; but the HTTP/2 `DATA` frames will contain each one or more WebSocket frames that both client and server know how to deliver to the respective WebSocket endpoints.

When either WebSocket endpoint decides to terminate the communication, the HTTP/2 stream will be closed as well.

[[pg-client-websocket-connect-custom-http-request]]
===== Customizing the Initial HTTP Request

Sometimes you need to add custom cookies, or other HTTP headers, or specify a WebSocket sub-protocol to the HTTP request that initiates the WebSocket communication.

You can do this by using overloaded versions of the `WebSocketClient.connect(...)` method:

----

[[pg-client-websocket-connect-inspect-http-response]]
===== Inspecting the Initial HTTP Response

If you want to inspect the HTTP response returned by the server as a reply to the  HTTP request that initiates the WebSocket communication, you may provide a `JettyUpgradeListener`:
