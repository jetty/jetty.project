[[pg-server-http-application]]
===== Writing HTTP Server Applications

Writing HTTP applications is typically simple, especially when using blocking APIs.
However, there are subtle cases where it is worth clarifying what a server application should do to obtain the desired results when run by Jetty.

[[pg-server-http-application-1xx]]
====== Sending 1xx Responses

The link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.1.1[HTTP/1.1 RFC] allows for `1xx` informational responses to be sent before a real content response.
Unfortunately the servlet specification does not provide a way for these to be sent, so Jetty has had to provide non-standard handling of these headers.

[[pg-server-http-application-100]]
====== 100 Continue

The `100 Continue` response should be sent by the server when a client sends a request with an `Expect: 100-continue` header, as the client will not send the body of the request until the `100 Continue` response has been sent.

The intent of this feature is to allow a server to inspect the headers and to tell the client to not send a request body that might be too large or insufficiently private or otherwise unable to be handled.

Jetty achieves this by waiting until the input stream or reader is obtained by the filter/servlet, before sending the `100 Continue` response.
Thus a filter/servlet may inspect the headers of a request before getting the input stream and send an error response (or redirect etc.) rather than the 100 continues.

[[jetty-102-processing]]
====== 102 Processing

link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518[RFC 2518] defined the `102 Processing` status code that can be sent:

[quote,RFC 2518 section 10.1]
when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will take significant time to complete.
As guidance, if a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a `102 Processing` response.

However, a later update of RFC 2518, link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918[RFC 4918], removed the `102 Processing` status code for link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#appendix-F.3["lack of implementation"].

Jetty supports the `102 Processing` status code.
If a request is received with the `Expect: 102-processing` header, then a filter/servlet may send a `102 Processing` response (without terminating further processing) by calling `response.sendError(102)`.

// TODO: add section to always read request content until -1 is reached.
