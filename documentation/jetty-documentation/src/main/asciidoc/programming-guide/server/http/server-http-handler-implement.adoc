===== Implementing Handler

The `Handler` API consist fundamentally of just one method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerAPI]
----

The `target` parameter is an identifier for the resource.
This is normally the URI that is parsed from an HTTP request.
However, a request could be forwarded to either a named resource, in which case `target` will be the name of the resource, or to a different URI, in which case `target` will be the new URI.

Applications may wrap the request or response (or both) and forward the wrapped request or response to a different URI (which may be possibly handled by a different `Handler`).
This is the reason why there are two request parameters in the `Handler` APIs: the first is the unwrapped, original, request that also gives access to Jetty-specific APIs, while the second is the application-wrapped Servlet request.

====== Hello World Handler

A simple "Hello World" `Handler` is the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerHello]
----

Such a simple `Handler` extends from `AbstractHandler` and can access the request and response main features, such as reading request headers and content, or writing response headers and content.

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-filter]]
====== Filtering Handler

A filtering `Handler` is a handler that perform some modification to the request or response, and then either forwards the request to another `Handler` or produces an error response:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerFilter]
----

Note how a filtering `Handler` extends from `Handler.Wrapper` and as such needs another handler to forward the request processing to, and how the two ``Handler``s needs to be linked together to work properly.
