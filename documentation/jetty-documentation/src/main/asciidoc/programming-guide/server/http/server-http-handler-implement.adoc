===== Implementing Handler

The `Handler` API consist fundamentally of just one method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerAPI]
----

The code that implements the `handle(\...)` method must respect the following contract:

* It may inspect `Request` immutable information such as URI and headers, typically to decide whether to return `true` or `false` (see below).
* Returning `false` means that the implementation will not handle the request, and it **must not** complete the `callback` parameter, nor read the request content, nor write response content.
* Returning `true` means that the implementation will handle the request, and it **must** eventually complete the `callback` parameter.
The completion of the `callback` parameter may happen synchronously within the invocation to `handle(\...)`, or at a later time, asynchronously, possibly from another thread.
If the response has not been explicitly written when the `callback` has been completed, the Jetty implementation will write a `200` response with no content if the `callback` has been succeeded, or an error response if the `callback` has been failed.

[CAUTION]
====
Violating the contract above may result in undefined or unexpected behavior, and possibly leak resources.

For example, returning `true` from `handle(\...)`, but not completing the `callback` parameter may result in the request or the response never be completed, likely causing the client to time out.

Similarly, returning `false` from `handle(\...)` but then either writing the response or completing the `callback` parameter will likely result in a garbled response be sent to the client, as the implementation will either invoke another `Handler` (that may write a response) or write a default response.
====

Applications may wrap the request, the response, or the callback and forward the wrapped request, response and callback to a child `Handler`.

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-hello]]
====== Hello World `Handler`

A simple "Hello World" `Handler` is the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerHello]
----

Such a simple `Handler` can access the request and response main features, such as xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-request[reading request headers and content], or xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-response[writing response headers and content].

Note how `HelloWorldHandler` extends from `Handler.Abstract.NonBlocking`.
This is a declaration that `HelloWorldHandler` does not use blocking APIs (of any kind) to perform its logic, allowing Jetty to apply optimizations that are not applied to ``Handler``s that declare themselves as blocking.

If your `Handler` implementation uses blocking APIs (of any kind), extend from `Handler.Abstract`.

Note how the `callback` parameter is passed to `Content.Sink.write(\...)` -- a utility method that eventually calls `Response.write(\...)`, so that when the write completes, also the `callback` parameter is completed.
Note also that because the `callback` parameter will eventually be completed, the value returned from `handle(\...)` is `true`.

In this way the xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl[`Handler` contract] is fully respected: when `true` is returned, the `callback` will eventually be completed.

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-filter]]
====== Filtering `Handler`

A filtering `Handler` is a handler that perform some modification to the request or response, and then either forwards the request to another `Handler` or produces an error response:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerFilter]
----

Note how a filtering `Handler` extends from `Handler.Wrapper` and as such needs another handler to forward the request processing to, and how the two ``Handler``s needs to be linked together to work properly.

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-request]]
====== Using the `Request`

The `Request` object can be accessed by web applications to inspect the HTTP request URI, the HTTP request headers and read the HTTP request content.

Since the `Request` object may be wrapped by xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-filter[filtering ``Handler``s], the design decision for the `Request` APIs was to keep the number of virtual methods at a minimum.
This minimizes the effort necessary to write `Request` wrapper implementations and provides a single source for the data carried by `Request` objects.

To use the `Request` APIs, you should look up the relevant methods in the following order:

1. `Request` virtual methods.
For example, `Request.getMethod()` returns the HTTP method used in the request, such as `GET`, `POST`, etc.
2. `Request` `static` methods.
These are utility methods that provide more convenient access to request features.
For example, the HTTP URI query is a string and can be directly accessed via the non-``static`` method `request.getHttpURI().getQuery()`; however, the query string typically holds key/value parameters and applications should not have the burden to parse the query string, so the `static Request.extractQueryParameters(Request)` method is provided.
3. Super class `static` methods.
Since `Request` _is-a_ `Content.Source`, look also for `static` methods in `Content.Source` that take a `Content.Source` as a parameter, so that you can pass the `Request` object as a parameter.

Below you can find a list of the most common `Request` features and how to access them.
Refer to the `Request` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/Request.html[javadocs] for the complete list.

`Request` URI::
The `Request` URI is accessed via `Request.getHttpURI()` and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpURI.html[`HttpURI`] APIs.

`Request` HTTP headers::
The `Request` HTTP headers are accessed via `Request.getHeaders()` and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpFields.html[`HttpFields`] APIs.

`Request` cookies::
The `Request` cookies are accessed via `static Request.getCookies(Request)` and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpCookie.html[`HttpCookie`] APIs.

`Request` parameters::
The `Request` parameters are accessed via `static Request.extractQueryParameters(Request)` for those present in the HTTP URI query, and via `static Request.getParametersAsync(Request)` for both query parameters and request content parameters received via form upload with `Content-Type: application/x-www-url-form-encoded`, and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/util/Fields.html[`Fields`] APIs.
If you are only interested in the request content parameters received via form upload, you can use `static FormFields.from(Request)`, see also xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-request-content[this section].

`Request` HTTP session::
The `Request` HTTP session is accessed via `Request.getSession(boolean)` and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/Session.html[`Session`] APIs.
For more information about how to set up support for HTTP sessions, see xref:pg-server-http-session[this section].

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-request-content]]
====== Reading the `Request` Content

Since `Request` _is-a_ `Content.Source`, the xref:pg-arch-io-content-source[section] about reading from `Content.Source` applies to `Request` as well.
The `static Content.Source` utility methods will allow you to read the request content as a string, or as an `InputStream`, for example.

There are two special cases that are specific to HTTP for the request content: form parameters (sent when submitting an HTML form) and multipart form data (sent when submitting an HTML form with file upload).

For form parameters, typical of HTML form submissions, you can use the `FormFields` APIs as shown here:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerForm]
----
<1> If the `Content-Type` is `x-www-form-urlencoded`, read the request content with `FormFields`.
<2> When all the request content has arrived, process the `Fields`.

[WARNING]
====
The `Handler` returns `true`, so the `callback` parameter **must** be completed.

It is therefore mandatory to use `CompletableFuture` APIs that are invoked even when reading the request content failed, such as `whenComplete(BiConsumer)`, `handle(BiFunction)`, `exceptionally(Function)`, etc.

Failing to do so may result in the `Handler` `callback` parameter to never be completed, causing the request processing to hang forever.
====

For multipart form data, typical for HTML form file uploads, you can use the `MultiPartFormData.Parser` APIs as shown here:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerMultiPart]
----
<1> If the `Content-Type` is `multipart/form-data`, read the request content with `MultiPartFormData.Parser`.
<2> When all the request content has arrived, process the `MultiPartFormData.Parts`.

[WARNING]
====
The `Handler` returns `true`, so the `callback` parameter **must** be completed.

It is therefore mandatory to use `CompletableFuture` APIs that are invoked even when reading the request content failed, such as `whenComplete(BiConsumer)`, `handle(BiFunction)`, `exceptionally(Function)`, etc.

Failing to do so may result in the `Handler` `callback` parameter to never be completed, causing the request processing to hang forever.
====

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-request-listeners]]
====== `Request` Listeners

Application may add listeners to the `Request` object to be notified of particular events happening during the request/response processing.

`Request.addIdleTimeoutListener(Predicate<TimeoutException>)` allows you to add an idle timeout listener, which is invoked when an idle timeout period elapses during the request/response processing, if the idle timeout event is not notified otherwise.

The idle timeout listener is invoked only when:

* There is no pending demand for request content; that is, there is not an outstanding call to `Request.demand(Runnable)`.
* There is no pending response write; that is, there is not an outstanding call to `Response.write(boolean, ByteBuffer, Callback)`.

In the above cases, the application is notified of the idle timeout so there is no need to call the idle timeout listeners.
In the first case, the demand `Runnable` is invoked and the application will see the idle timeout failure by reading from the `Request`, obtaining a xref:pg-arch-io-content-source[transient failure chunk].
In the second case, the response write `Callback` will be failed.

The idle timeout listeners are therefore invoked only when the application is really idle, neither trying to read nor trying to write.

An idle timeout listener may return `false` to indicate to the Jetty implementation that the idle timeout should be ignored, and `true` to indicate that the idle timeout should be treated as a fatal failure of the request/response processing.
When an idle timeout listener returns `false`, and another idle timeout period elapses, and the application is idle, the listener is invoked again.

In case of many idle timeout listeners, they are invoked in the same order they have been added.
The first idle timeout listener that returns `true` stops the Jetty implementation from invoking the idle timeout listeners that follow.

`Request.addFailureListener(Consumer<Throwable>)` allows you to add a failure listener, which is invoked when a failure happens during the request/response processing.

When a failure happens during the request/response processing, then:

* The pending demand for request content, if any, is invoked; that is, the `Runnable` passed to `Request.demand(Runnable)` is invoked.
* The callback of an outstanding call to `Response.write(boolean, ByteBuffer, Callback)`, if any, is failed.
* The failure listeners are invoked, in the same order they have been added.

Failure listeners are invoked also in case of idle timeouts, in the following cases:

* At least one idle timeout listener returned `true` to indicate to the Jetty implementation to treat the idle timeout as a fatal failure.
* There are no idle timeout listeners.

Failures reported to a failure listener are always fatal failures; see also xref:pg-arch-io-content-source[this section] about fatal versus transient failures.

[NOTE]
====
Applications are always required to complete the `Handler` callback, as described xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl[here].
In case of asynchronous failures, failure listeners are a good place to complete (typically by failing it) the `Handler` callback.
====

`Request.addCompletionListener(Consumer<Throwable>)` allows you to add a completion listener, which is invoked at the very end of the request/response processing.
This is equivalent to adding an `HttpStream` wrapper and overriding both `HttpStream.succeeded()` and `HttpStream.failed(Throwable)`.

Completion listeners are typically (but not only) used to recycle or dispose resources used during the request/response processing, or get a precise timing for when the request/response processing finishes, to be paired with `Request.getBeginNanoTime()`.

Note that while failure listeners are invoked as soon as the failure happens, completion listeners are invoked only at the very end of the request/response processing.

In case of many completion listeners, they are invoked in the reverse order they have been added.

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-response]]
====== Using the `Response`

The `Response` object can be accessed by web applications to set the HTTP response status code, the HTTP response headers and write the HTTP response content.

The design of the `Response` APIs is similar to that of the `Request` APIs, described in xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-request[this section].

To use the `Response` APIs, you should look up the relevant methods in the following order:

1. `Response` virtual methods.
For example, `Response.setStatus(int)` to set the HTTP response status code.
2. `Request` `static` methods.
These are utility methods that provide more convenient access to response features.
For example, adding an HTTP cookie could be done by adding a `Set-Cookie` response header, but it would be extremely error-prone.
The utility method `static Response.addCookie(Response, HttpCookie)` is provided instead.
3. Super class `static` methods.
Since `Response` _is-a_ `Content.Sink`, look also for `static` methods in `Content.Sink` that take a `Content.Sink` as a parameter, so that you can pass the `Response` object as a parameter.

Below you can find a list of the most common `Response` features and how to access them.
Refer to the `Response` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/Response.html[javadocs] for the complete list.

`Response` status code::
The `Response` HTTP status code is accessed via `Response.getStatus()` and `Response.setStatus(int)`.

`Response` HTTP headers::
The `Response` HTTP headers are accessed via `Response.getHeaders()` and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpFields.Mutable.html[`HttpFields.Mutable`] APIs.
The response headers are mutable until the response is _committed_, as defined in xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-response-content[this section].

`Response` cookies::
The `Response` cookies are accessed via `static Response.addCookie(Response, HttpCookie)`, `static Response.replaceCookie(Response, HttpCookie)` and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http/HttpCookie.html[`HttpCookie`] APIs.
Since cookies translate to HTTP headers, they can be added/replaces until the response is _committed_, as defined in xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl-response-content[this section].

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-response-content]]
====== Writing the `Response` Content

Since `Response` _is-a_ `Content.Sink`, the xref:pg-arch-io-content-sink[section] about writing to `Content.Sink` applies to `Response` as well.
The `static Content.Sink` utility methods will allow you to write the response content as a string, or as an `OutputStream`, for example.

IMPORTANT: The first call to `Response.write(boolean, ByteBuffer, Callback)` _commits_ the response.

Committing the response means that the response status code and response headers are sent to the other peer, and therefore cannot be modified anymore.
Trying to modify them may result in an `IllegalStateException` to be thrown, as it is an application mistake to commit the response and then try to modify the headers.

You can explicitly commit the response by performing an empty, non-last write:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=flush]
----

[WARNING]
====
The `Handler` returns `true`, so the `callback` parameter **must** be completed.

It is therefore mandatory to use `CompletableFuture` APIs that are invoked even when writing the response content failed, such as `whenComplete(BiConsumer)`, `handle(BiFunction)`, `exceptionally(Function)`, etc.

Failing to do so may result in the `Handler` `callback` parameter to never be completed, causing the request processing to hang forever.
====

Jetty can perform important optimizations for the HTTP/1.1 protocol if the response content length is known before the response is committed:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=contentLength]
----

NOTE: Setting the response content length is an _optimization_; Jetty will work well even without it.
If you set the response content length, however, remember that it must specify the number of _bytes_, not the number of characters.

[[pg-server-http-handler-impl-response-interim]]
====== Sending Interim ``Response``s

The HTTP protocol (any version) allows applications to write link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#name-status-codes[interim responses].

An interim response has a status code in the `1xx` range (but not `101`), and an application may write zero or more interim response before the final response.

This is an example of writing an interim `100 Continue` response:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=continue]
----
<1> Using `Response.writeInterim(\...)` to send the interim response.
<2> The completion of the callback must take into account both success and failure.

Note how writing an interim response is as asynchronous operation.
As such you must perform subsequent operations using the `CompletableFuture` APIs, and remember to complete the `Handler` `callback` parameter both in case of success or in case of failure.

This is an example of writing an interim `103 Early Hints` response:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=earlyHints103]
----
<1> Using `Response.writeInterim(\...)` to send the interim response.
<2> The completion of the callback must take into account both success and failure.

An interim response may or may not have its own HTTP headers (this depends on the interim response status code), and they are typically different from the final response HTTP headers.
