===== Jetty Handlers

Web applications are the unit of deployment in an HTTP server or Servlet container such as Jetty.

Two different web applications are typically deployed on different __context path__s, where a _context path_ is the initial segment of the URI path.
For example, web application `webappA` that implements a web user interface for an e-commerce site may be deployed to context path `/shop`, while web application `webappB` that implements a REST API for the e-commerce business may be deployed to `/api`.

A client making a request to URI `/shop/cart` is directed by Jetty to `webappA`, while a request to URI `/api/products` is directed to `webappB`.

An alternative way to deploy the two web applications of the example above is to use _virtual hosts_.
A _virtual host_ is a subdomain of the primary domain that shares the same IP address with the primary domain.
If the e-commerce business primary domain is `domain.com`, then a virtual host for `webappA` could be `shop.domain.com`, while a virtual host for `webappB` could be `api.domain.com`.

Web application `webappA` can now be deployed to virtual host `shop.domain.com` and context path `/`, while web application `webappB` can be deployed to virtual host `api.domain.com` and context path `/`.
Both applications have the same context path `/`, but they can be distinguished by the subdomain.

A client making a request to `+https://shop.domain.com/cart+` is directed by Jetty to `webappA`, while a request to `+https://api.domain.com/products+` is directed to `webappB`.

Therefore, in general, a web application is deployed to a _context_ which can be seen as the pair `(virtual_host, context_path)`.
In the first case the contexts were `(domain.com, /shop)` and `(domain.com, /api)`, while in the second case the contexts were `(shop.domain.com, /)` and `(api.domain.com, /)`.
Server applications using the Jetty Server Libraries create and configure a _context_ for each web application.
Many __context__s can be deployed together to enrich the web application offering -- for example a catalog context, a shop context, an API context, an administration context, etc.

Web applications can be written using exclusively the Servlet APIs, since developers know well the Servlet API and because they guarantee better portability across Servlet container implementations, as described in xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet[this section].

On the other hand, web applications can be written using the Jetty APIs, for better performance, or to be able to  access to Jetty specific APIs, or to use features such as redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, support for `gzip` content compression, URI rewriting, etc.
The Jetty Server Libraries provides a number of out-of-the-box ``Handler``s that implement the most common functionalities and are described in the next sections.

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-context]]
====== ContextHandler

`ContextHandler` is a `Handler` that represents a _context_ for a web application.
It is a `Handler.Wrapper` that performs some action before and after delegating to the nested `Handler`.
// TODO: expand on what the ContextHandler does, e.g. ServletContext.

The simplest use of `ContextHandler` is the following:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=contextHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── ContextHandler /shop
    └── ShopHandler
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-context-collection]]
====== ContextHandlerCollection

Server applications may need to deploy to Jetty more than one web application.

Recall from the xref:pg-server-http-handler[introduction] that Jetty offers `Handler.Collection` that contains a sequence of child ``Handler``s.
However, this has no knowledge of the concept of _context_ and just iterates through the sequence of ``Handler``s.

A better choice for multiple web application is `ContextHandlerCollection`, that matches a _context_ from either its _context path_ or _virtual host_, without iterating through the ``Handler``s.

If `ContextHandlerCollection` does not find a match, it just returns `false` from its `handle(\...)` method.
What happens next depends on the `Handler` tree structure: other ``Handler``s may be invoked after `ContextHandlerCollection`, for example `DefaultHandler` (see xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-default[this section]).
Eventually, if no `Handler` returns `true` from their own `handle(\...)` method, then Jetty returns an HTTP `404` response to the client.

[source,java,indent=0]

include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=contextHandlerCollection]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── ContextHandlerCollection
    ├── ContextHandler /shop
    │   └── ShopHandler
    └── ContextHandler /api
        └── RESTHandler
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-resource]]
====== ResourceHandler -- Static Content

Static content such as images or files (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) can be sent by Jetty very efficiently because Jetty can write the content asynchronously, using direct ``ByteBuffer``s to minimize data copy, and using a memory cache for faster access to the data to send.

Being able to write content asynchronously means that if the network gets congested (for example, the client reads the content very slowly) and the server stalls the send of the requested data, then Jetty will wait to resume the send _without_ blocking a thread to finish the send.

`ResourceHandler` supports the following features:

* Welcome files, for example serving `/index.html` for request URI `/`
* Precompressed resources, serving a precompressed `/document.txt.gz` for request URI `/document.txt`
* link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233[Range requests], for requests containing the `Range` header, which allows clients to pause and resume downloads of large files
* Directory listing, serving a HTML page with the file list of the requested directory
* Conditional headers, for requests containing the `If-Match`, `If-None-Match`, `If-Modified-Since`, `If-Unmodified-Since` headers.

The number of features supported and the efficiency in sending static content are on the same level as those of common front-end servers used to serve static content such as Nginx or Apache.
Therefore, the traditional architecture where Nginx/Apache was the front-end server used only to send static content and Jetty was the back-end server used only to send dynamic content is somehow obsolete as Jetty can perform efficiently both tasks.
This leads to simpler systems (less components to configure and manage) and more performance (no need to proxy dynamic requests from front-end servers to back-end servers).

NOTE: It is common to use Nginx/Apache as load balancers, or as rewrite/redirect servers.
We typically recommend link:https://haproxy.org[HAProxy] as load balancer, and Jetty has xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-rewrite[rewrite/redirect features] as well.

This is how you configure a `ResourceHandler` to create a simple file server:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=resourceHandler]
----

If you need to serve static resources from multiple directories:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=multipleResourcesHandler]
----

If the resource is not found, `ResourceHandler` will not return `true` from the `handle(\...)` method, so what happens next depends on the `Handler` tree structure.
See also xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-default[how to use] `DefaultHandler`.

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-gzip]]
====== GzipHandler

`GzipHandler` provides supports for automatic decompression of compressed request content and automatic compression of response content.

`GzipHandler` is a `Handler.Wrapper` that inspects the request and, if the request matches the `GzipHandler` configuration, just installs the required components to eventually perform decompression of the request content or compression of the response content.
The decompression/compression is not performed until the web application reads request content or writes response content.

`GzipHandler` can be configured at the server level in this way:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=serverGzipHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── GzipHandler
    └── ContextHandlerCollection
        ├── ContextHandler 1
        :── ...
        └── ContextHandler N
----

However, in less common cases, you can configure `GzipHandler` on a per-context basis, for example because you want to configure `GzipHandler` with different parameters for each context, or because you want only some contexts to have compression support:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=contextGzipHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── ContextHandlerCollection
    └── ContextHandlerCollection
        ├── GzipHandler
        │   └── ContextHandler /shop
        │       └── ShopHandler
        └── ContextHandler /api
            └── RESTHandler
----

// TODO: does ServletContextHandler really need a special configuration?

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-rewrite]]
====== RewriteHandler

`RewriteHandler` provides support for URL rewriting, very similarly to link:https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html[Apache's mod_rewrite] or link:https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_rewrite_module.html[Nginx rewrite module].

The Maven artifact coordinates are:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-rewrite</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

`RewriteHandler` can be configured with a set of __rule__s; a _rule_ inspects the request and when it matches it performs some change to the request (for example, changes the URI path, adds/removes headers, etc.).

The Jetty Server Libraries provide rules for the most common usages, but you can write your own rules by extending the `org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.Rule` class.

Please refer to the `jetty-rewrite` module link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/rewrite/handler/package-summary.html[javadocs] for the complete list of available rules.

You typically want to configure `RewriteHandler` at the server level, although it is possible to configure it on a per-context basis.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=rewriteHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── RewriteHandler
    └── ContextHandlerCollection
        ├── ContextHandler 1
        :── ...
        └── ContextHandler N
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-sizelimit]]
====== SizeLimitHandler

`SizeLimitHandler` tracks the sizes of request content and response content, and fails the request processing with an HTTP status code of link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-413-content-too-large[`413 Content Too Large`].

Server applications can set up the `SizeLimitHandler` before or after handlers that modify the request content or response content such as xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-gzip[`GzipHandler`].
When `SizeLimitHandler` is before `GzipHandler` in the `Handler` tree, it will limit the compressed content; when it is after, it will limit the uncompressed content.

The `Handler` tree structure look like the following, to limit uncompressed content:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── GzipHandler
    └── SizeLimitHandler
        └── ContextHandlerCollection
            ├── ContextHandler 1
            :── ...
            └── ContextHandler N
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-statistics]]
====== StatisticsHandler

`StatisticsHandler` gathers and exposes a number of statistic values related to request processing such as:

* Total number of requests
* Current number of concurrent requests
* Minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation of request processing times
* Number of responses grouped by HTTP code (i.e. how many `2xx` responses, how many `3xx` responses, etc.)
* Total response content bytes

Server applications can read these values and use them internally, or expose them via some service, or xref:pg-arch-jmx[export them to JMX].

`StatisticsHandler` can be configured at the server level or at the context level.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=statisticsHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── StatisticsHandler
    └── ContextHandlerCollection
        ├── ContextHandler 1
        :── ...
        └── ContextHandler N
----

It is possible to act on those statistics by subclassing `StatisticsHandler`.
For instance, `StatisticsHandler.MinimumDataRateHandler` can be used to enforce a minimum read rate and a minimum write rate based of the figures collected by the `StatisticsHandler`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=dataRateHandler]
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-events]]
====== EventsHandler

`EventsHandler` allows applications to be notified of xref:pg-server-http-request-processing-events[request processing] events.

`EventsHandler` must be subclassed, and the relevant `onXYZ()` methods overridden to capture the request processing events you are interested in.
The request processing events can be used in conjunction with `Request` APIs that provide the information you may be interested in.

For example, if you want to use `EventsHandler` to record processing times, you can use the request processing events with the following `Request` APIs:

* `Request.getBeginNanoTime()`, which returns the earliest possible nanoTime the request was received.
* `Request.getHeadersNanoTime()`, which returns the nanoTime at which the parsing of the HTTP headers was completed.

[CAUTION]
====
The `Request` and `Response` objects may be inspected during events, but it is recommended to avoid modifying them, for example by adding/removing headers or by reading/writing content, because any modification may interfere with the processing performed by other ``Handler``s.
====

`EventsHandler` emits the following events:

`beforeHandling`::
Emitted just before `EventsHandler` invokes the `Handler.handle(\...)` method of the next `Handler` in the `Handler` tree.
`afterHandling`::
Emitted just after the invocation to the `Handler.handle(\...)` method of the next `Handler` in the `Handler` tree returns, either normally or by throwing.
`requestRead`::
Emitted every time a chunk of content is read from the `Request`.
`responseBegin`::
Emitted when the response first write happens.
`responseWrite`::
Emitted every time the write of some response content is initiated.
`responseWriteComplete`::
Emitted every time the write of some response content is completed, either successfully or with a failure.
`responseTrailersComplete`::
Emitted when the write of the response trailers is completed.
`complete`::
Emitted when both request and the response have been completely processed.

Your `EventsHandler` subclass should then be linked in the `Handler` tree in the relevant position, typically as the outermost `Handler` after `Server`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=eventsHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── MyEventsHandler
    └── ContextHandler /app
----

You can link the `EventsHandler` at any point in the `Handler` tree structure, and even have multiple ``EventsHandler``s to be notified of the request processing events at the different stages of the `Handler` tree, for example:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── TotalEventsHandler
    └── SlowHandler
        └── AppEventsHandler
            └── ContextHandler /app
----

In the example above, `TotalEventsHandler` may record the total times of request processing, from `SlowHandler` all the way to the `ContextHandler`.
On the other hand, `AppEventsHandler` may record both the time it takes for the request to flow from `TotalEventsHandler` to `AppEventsHandler`, therefore effectively measuring the processing time due to `SlowHandler`, and the time it takes to process the request by the `ContextHandler`.

Refer to the `EventsHandler` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/EventsHandler.html[javadocs] for further information.

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-qos]]
====== QoSHandler

`QoSHandler` allows web applications to limit the number of concurrent requests, therefore implementing a quality of service (QoS) mechanism for end users.

Web applications may need to access resources with limited capacity, for example a relational database accessed through a JDBC connection pool.

Consider the case where each HTTP request results in a JDBC query, and the capacity of the database is of 400 queries/s.
Allowing more than 400 HTTP requests/s into the system, for example 500 requests/s, results in 100 requests blocking waiting for a JDBC connection _for every second_.
It is evident that even a short load spike of few seconds eventually results in consuming all the server threads: some will be processing requests and queries, the remaining will be blocked waiting for a JDBC connection.
When no more threads are available, additional requests will queue up as tasks in the thread pool, consuming more memory and potentially causing a complete server failure.
This situation affects the whole server, so one bad behaving web application may affect other well behaving web applications.
From the end user perspective the quality of service is terrible, because requests will take a lot of time to be served and eventually time out.

In cases of load spikes, caused for example by popular events (weather or social events), usage bursts (Black Friday sales), or even denial of service attacks, it is desirable to give priority to certain requests rather than others.
For example, in an e-commerce site requests that lead to the checkout and to the payments should have higher priorities than requests to browse the products.
Another example is to prioritize requests for certain users such as paying users or administrative users.

`QoSHandler` allows you to configure the maximum number of concurrent requests; by extending `QoSHandler` you can prioritize suspended requests for faster processing.

A simple example that just limits the number of concurrent requests:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=simpleQoSHandler]
----

This is an example of a `QoSHandler` subclass where you can implement a custom prioritization logic:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=advancedQoSHandler]
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-secured]]
====== SecuredRedirectHandler -- Redirect from HTTP to HTTPS

`SecuredRedirectHandler` allows to redirect requests made with the `http` scheme (and therefore to the clear-text port) to the `https` scheme (and therefore to the encrypted port).

For example a request to `+http://domain.com:8080/path?param=value+` is redirected to `+https://domain.com:8443/path?param=value+`.

Server applications must configure a `HttpConfiguration` object with the secure scheme and secure port so that `SecuredRedirectHandler` can build the redirect URI.

`SecuredRedirectHandler` is typically configured at the server level, although it can be configured on a per-context basis.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=securedHandler]
----

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-cross-origin]]
====== CrossOriginHandler

`CrossOriginHandler` supports the server-side requirements of the link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[CORS protocol] implemented by browsers when performing cross-origin requests.

An example of a cross-origin request is when a script downloaded from the origin domain `+http://domain.com+` uses `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` to make a request to a cross domain such as `+http://cross.domain.com+` (a subdomain of the origin domain) or to `+http://example.com+` (a completely different domain).

This is common, for example, when you embed reusable components such as a chat component into a web page: the web page and the chat component files are downloaded from `+http://domain.com+`, but the chat server is at `+http://chat.domain.com+`, so the chat component must make cross-origin requests to the chat server.

This kind of setup exposes to link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf[cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks], and the CORS protocol has been established to protect against this kind of attacks.

For security reasons, browsers by default do not allow cross-origin requests, unless the response from the cross domain contains the right CORS headers.

`CrossOriginHandler` relieves server-side web applications from handling CORS headers explicitly.
You can set up your `Handler` tree with the `CrossOriginHandler`, configure it, and it will take care of the CORS headers separately from your application, where you can concentrate on the business logic.

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── CrossOriginHandler
    └── ContextHandler /app
        └── AppHandler
----

The most important `CrossOriginHandler` configuration parameter that must be configured is `allowedOrigins`, which by default is the empty set, therefore disallowing all origins.

You want to restrict requests to your cross domain to only origins you trust.
From the chat example above, the chat server at `+http://chat.domain.com+` knows that the chat component is downloaded from the origin server at `+http://domain.com+`, so the `CrossOriginHandler` is configured in this way:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=crossOriginAllowedOrigins]
----

Browsers send cross-origin requests in two ways:

* Directly, if the cross-origin request meets some simple criteria.
* By issuing a hidden _preflight_ request before the actual cross-origin request, to verify with the server if it is willing to reply properly to the actual cross-origin request.

Both preflight requests and cross-origin requests will be handled by `CrossOriginHandler`, which will analyze the request and possibly add appropriate CORS response headers.

By default, preflight requests are not delivered to the `CrossOriginHandler` child `Handler`, but it is possible to configure `CrossOriginHandler` by setting `deliverPreflightRequests=true` so that the web application can fine-tune the CORS response headers.

Another important `CrossOriginHandler` configuration parameter is `allowCredentials`, which controls whether cookies and authentication headers that match the cross-origin request to the cross domain are sent in the cross-origin requests.
By default, `allowCredentials=false` so that cookies and authentication headers are not sent in cross-origin requests.

If the application deployed in the cross domain requires cookies or authentication, then you must set `allowCredentials=true`, but you also need to restrict the allowed origins only to the ones your trust, otherwise your cross domain application will be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

For more `CrossOriginHandler` configuration options, refer to the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/CrossOriginHandler.html[`CrossOriginHandler` javadocs].

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-state-tracking]]
====== StateTrackingHandler

`StateTrackingHandler` is a xref:pg-troubleshooting[troubleshooting] `Handler` that tracks whether `Handler`/`Request`/`Response` asynchronous APIs are properly used by applications.</p>

Asynchronous APIs are notoriously more difficult to troubleshoot than blocking APIs, and may be subject to restrictions that applications need to respect (a typical case is that they cannot perform blocking operations).

For example, a `Handler` implementation whose `handle(\...)` method returns `true` _must_ eventually complete the callback passed to `handle(\...)` (for more details on the `Handler` APIs, see xref:pg-server-http-handler-impl[this section]).

When an application forgets to complete the callback passed to `handle(\...)`, the HTTP response may not be sent to the client, but it will be difficult to troubleshoot why the client is not receiving responses.

`StateTrackingHandler` helps with this troubleshooting because it tracks the callback passed to `handle(\...)` and emits an event if the callback is not completed within a configurable timeout:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=stateTrackingHandle]
----

By default, events are logged at warning level, but it is possible to specify a listener to be notified of the events tracked by `StateTrackingHandler`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=stateTrackingListener]
----

Other events tracked by `StateTrackingHandler` are demand callbacks that block, writes that do not complete their callbacks, or write callbacks that block.
The complete list of events is specified by the `StateTrackingHandler.Listener` class (link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/handler/StateTrackingHandler.Listener.html[javadocs]).

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-default]]
====== DefaultHandler

`DefaultHandler` is a terminal `Handler` that always returns `true` from its `handle(\...)` method and performs the following:

* Serves the `favicon.ico` Jetty icon when it is requested
* Sends a HTTP `404` response for any other request
* The HTTP `404` response content nicely shows a HTML table with all the contexts deployed on the `Server` instance

`DefaultHandler` is set directly on the server, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=defaultHandler]
----

The `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
  ├── ContextHandlerCollection
  │   ├── ContextHandler 1
  │   :── ...
  │   └── ContextHandler N
  └── DefaultHandler
----

In the example above, `ContextHandlerCollection` will try to match a request to one of the contexts; if the match fails, `Server` will call the `DefaultHandler` that will return a HTTP `404` with an HTML page showing the existing contexts deployed on the `Server`.

NOTE: `DefaultHandler` just sends a nicer HTTP `404` response in case of wrong requests from clients.
Jetty will send an HTTP `404` response anyway if `DefaultHandler` has not been set.

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet]]
===== Servlet API Handlers

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context]]
====== ServletContextHandler

``Handler``s are easy to write, but often web applications have already been written using the Servlet APIs, using ``Servlet``s and ``Filter``s.

`ServletContextHandler` is a `ContextHandler` that provides support for the Servlet APIs and implements the behaviors required by the Servlet specification.

However, differently from xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context[`WebAppContext`], it does not require web application to be packaged as a `+*.war+`, nor it requires a `web.xml` for configuration.

With `ServletContextHandler` you can just put all your Servlet components in a `+*.jar+` and configure each component using the `ServletContextHandler` APIs, in a way equivalent to what you would write in a `web.xml`.

The Maven artifact coordinates depend on the version of Jakarta EE you want to use, and they are:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.{ee-all}</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-{ee-all}-servlet</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

For example, for Jakarta {ee-current-caps} the coordinates are: `org.eclipse.jetty.{ee-current}:jetty-{ee-current}-servlet:{version}`.

Below you can find an example of how to set up a Jakarta {ee-current-caps} `ServletContextHandler`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=servletContextHandler-servlet]
----
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=servletContextHandler-setup]
----

The `Handler` and Servlet components tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Server
└── ServletContextHandler /shop
    ├── _ShopCartServlet /cart/*_
    └── _CrossOriginFilter /*_
----

Note how the Servlet components (they are not ``Handler``s) are represented in _italic_.

Note also how adding a `Servlet` or a `Filter` returns a _holder_ object that can be used to specify additional configuration for that particular `Servlet` or `Filter`, for example initialization parameters (equivalent to `<init-param>` in `web.xml`).

When a request arrives to `ServletContextHandler` the request URI will be matched against the ``Filter``s and ``Servlet`` mappings and only those that match will process the request, as dictated by the Servlet specification.

IMPORTANT: `ServletContextHandler` is a terminal `Handler`, that is it always returns `true` from its `handle(\...)` method when invoked.
Server applications must be careful when creating the `Handler` tree to put ``ServletContextHandler``s as last ``Handler``s in any `Handler.Collection` or as children of a `ContextHandlerCollection`.

// TODO: revise what above, as ServletContextHandler is not a terminal handler.
// TODO: introduce the fact that ServletContextHandler can have a class loader that may be used to "isolate" web application classes.

[[pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context]]
====== WebAppContext

`WebAppContext` is a `ServletContextHandler` that autoconfigures itself by reading a `web.xml` Servlet configuration file.

The Maven artifact coordinates depend on the version of Jakarta EE you want to use, and they are:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.{ee-all}</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-{ee-all}-webapp</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>

Server applications can specify a `+*.war+` file or a directory with the structure of a `+*.war+` file to `WebAppContext` to deploy a standard Servlet web application packaged as a `war` (as defined by the Servlet specification).

Where server applications using `ServletContextHandler` must manually invoke methods to add ``Servlet``s and ``Filter``s as described in xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context[this section], `WebAppContext` reads `WEB-INF/web.xml` to add ``Servlet``s and ``Filter``s, and also enforces a number of restrictions defined by the Servlet specification, in particular related to class loading.

.WebAppContext Class Loading

The Servlet specification requires that a web application class loader must load the web application classes from `WEB-INF/classes` and `WEB_INF/lib`.
The web application class loader is special because it behaves differently from typical class loaders: where typical class loaders first delegate to their parent class loader and then try to find the class locally, the web application class loader first tries to find the class locally and then delegates to the parent class loader.
The typical class loading model, parent-first, is _inverted_ for web application class loaders, as they use a child-first model.

Furthermore, the Servlet specification requires that web applications cannot load or otherwise access the Servlet container implementation classes, also called _server classes_.
Web applications receive the HTTP request object as an instance of the `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` interface, and cannot downcast it to the Jetty specific implementation of that interface to access Jetty specific features -- this ensures maximum web application portability across Servlet container implementations.

Lastly, the Servlet specification requires that other classes, also called _system classes_, such as `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest` or JDK classes such as `java.lang.String` or `java.sql.Connection` cannot be modified by web applications by putting, for example, modified versions of those classes in `WEB-INF/classes` so that they are loaded first by the web application class loader (instead of the class-path class loader where they are normally loaded from).

`WebAppContext` implements this class loader logic using a single class loader, `WebAppClassLoader`, with filtering capabilities: when it loads a class, it checks whether the class is a _system class_ or a _server class_ and acts according to the Servlet specification.

When `WebAppClassLoader` is asked to load a class, it first tries to find the class locally (since it must use the inverted child-first model); if the class is found, and it is not a _system class_, the class is loaded; otherwise the class is not found locally.
If the class is not found locally, the parent class loader is asked to load the class; the parent class loader uses the standard parent-first model, so it delegates the class loading to its parent, and so on.
If the class is found, and it is not a _server class_, the class is loaded; otherwise the class is not found and a `ClassNotFoundException` is thrown.

Unfortunately, the Servlet specification does not define exactly which classes are _system classes_ and which classes are _server classes_.
However, Jetty picks good defaults and allows server applications to customize _system classes_ and _server classes_ in `WebAppContext`.

====== DefaultServlet -- Static Content for Servlets

If you have a xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context[Servlet web application], you may want to use a `DefaultServlet` instead of `ResourceHandler`.
The features are similar, but `DefaultServlet` is more commonly used to serve static files for Servlet web applications.

The Maven artifact coordinates depend on the version of Jakarta EE you want to use, and they are:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.{ee-all}</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-{ee-all}-servlet</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>

Below you can find an example of how to setup `DefaultServlet`:

If you wish to serve resources from a non-default location, then the `ResourceServlet` should be used instead of the `DefaultServlet`. Below you can find an example of how to setup both a `DefaultServlet` and a `ResourceServlet`:
