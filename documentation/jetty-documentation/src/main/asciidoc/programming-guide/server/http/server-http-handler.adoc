==== Server Handlers

An `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler` is the component that processes incoming HTTP requests and eventually produces HTTP responses.

``Handler``s can be organized in different ways:

* in a sequence, where ``Handler``s are invoked one after the other
** `HandlerCollection` invokes _all_ ``Handler``s one after the other
** `HandlerList` invokes ``Handlers``s until one calls `Request.setHandled(true)` to indicate that the request has been handled and no further `Handler` should be invoked
* nested, where one `Handler` invokes the next, nested, `Handler`
** `HandlerWrapper` implements this behavior

The `HandlerCollection` behavior (invoking _all_ handlers) is useful when for example the last `Handler` is a logging `Handler` that logs the request (that may have been modified by previous handlers).

The `HandlerList` behavior (invoking handlers up to the first that calls `Request.setHandled(true)`) is useful when each handler processes a different URIs or a different virtual hosts: ``Handler``s are invoked one after the other until one matches the URI or virtual host.

The nested behavior is useful to enrich the request with additional services such as HTTP session support (`SessionHandler`), or with specific behaviors dictated by the Servlet specification (`ServletHandler`).

``Handler``s can be organized in a tree by composing them together:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=handlerTree]
----

The corresponding `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
HandlerCollection
├── HandlerList
│   ├── App1Handler
│   └── HandlerWrapper
│       └── App2Handler
└── LoggingHandler
----

Server applications should rarely write custom ``Handler``s, preferring instead to use existing ``Handler``s provided by the Jetty Server Libraries for managing web application contexts, security, HTTP sessions and Servlet support.
Refer to xref:pg-server-http-handler-use[this section] for more information about how to use the ``Handler``s provided by the Jetty Server Libraries.

However, in some cases the additional features are not required, or additional constraints on memory footprint, or performance, or just simplicity must be met.
In these cases, implementing your own `Handler` may be a better solution.
Refer to xref:pg-server-http-handler-implement[this section] for more information about how to write your own ``Handler``s.

// TODO: document ScopedHandler? Is this really necessary or just an implementation detail that application will never worry about?
