==== Request Customizers

A request customizer is an instance of `HttpConfiguration.Customizer` and allows to customize the HTTP request and/or the HTTP response headers _before_ the `Handler` chain is invoked.

Request customizers are added to a particular `HttpConfiguration` instance, and therefore are specific to a `Connector` instance: you can have two different ``Connector``s configured with different request customizers.

For example, it is common to configure a secure `Connector` with the `SecureRequestCustomizer` that customizes the HTTP request by adding attributes that expose TLS data associated with the secure communication.

A request customizer may:

* Process HTTP request headers, for example those injected by a proxy, and then wrap the `Request` and/or the associated `ConnectionMetaData` to transparently provide the data to applications, as if the proxy was not present.
* Synthesize HTTP request headers from other information, for example see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-host[this section].
* Wrap the `Request` object to make it secure or authenticated, if that information has been communicated via HTTP request headers, or even via out-of-band mechanisms.

The out-of-the-box request customizers are:

* `ForwardedRequestCustomizer` -- to interpret the `Forwarded` (or the the obsolete ``+X-Forwarded-*+``) HTTP header added by a reverse proxy; see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-forwarded[this section].
* `HostHeaderCustomizer` -- to customize, or synthesize it when original absent, the HTTP `Host` header; see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-host[this section].
* `ProxyCustomizer` -- to expose as `Request` attributes the `ip:port` information carried by the PROXY protocol; see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-proxy[this section].
* `RewriteCustomizer` -- to rewrite the request URI; see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-rewrite[this section].
* `SecureRequestCustomizer` -- to expose TLS data via `Request` attributes; see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-secure[this section].

You can also write your own request customizer and add it to `HttpConfiguration` instance along existing request customizers.
Multiple request customizers will be invoked in the order they have been added.

Below you can find an example of how to add a request customizer:

[[pg-server-http-request-customizer-forwarded]]
===== `ForwardedRequestCustomizer`

`ForwardedRequestCustomizer` should be added when Jetty receives requests from a reverse proxy on behalf of a remote client, and web applications need to access the remote client information.

The reverse proxy adds the `Forwarded` (or the obsolete ``+X-Forwarded-*+``) HTTP header to the request, and may offload TLS so that the request arrives in clear-text to Jetty.

Applications deployed in Jetty may need to access information related to the remote client, for example the remote IP address and port, or whether the request was sent through a secure communication channel.
However, the request is forwarded by the reverse proxy, so the direct information about the remote IP address is that of the proxy, not of the remote client.
Furthermore, the proxy may offload TLS and forward the request in clear-text, so that the URI scheme would be `http` as forwarded by the reverse proxy, not `https` as sent by the remote client.

`ForwardedRequestCustomizer` reads the `Forwarded` header where the reverse proxy saved the remote client information, and wraps the original `Request` so that applications will transparently see the remote client information when calling methods such as `Request.isSecure()`, or `Request.getConnectionMetaData().getRemoteSocketAddress()`, etc.

For more information about how to configure `ForwardedRequestCustomizer`, see also link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ForwardedRequestCustomizer.html[the javadocs].

[[pg-server-http-request-customizer-host]]
===== `HostHeaderCustomizer`

`HostHeaderCustomizer` should be added when Jetty receives requests that may lack the `Host` HTTP header, such as HTTP/1.0, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 requests, and web applications have logic that depends on the value of the `Host` HTTP header.

For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the `Host` HTTP header is missing because the authority information is carried by the `:authority` pseudo-header, as per the respective specifications.

`HostHeaderCustomizer` will look at the `:authority` pseudo-header, then wrap the original `Request` adding a `Host` HTTP header synthesized from the `:authority` pseudo-header.
In this way, web applications that rely on the presence of the `Host` HTTP header will work seamlessly in any HTTP protocol version.

`HostHeaderCustomizer` works also for the WebSocket protocol.

WebSocket over HTTP/2 or over HTTP/3 initiate the WebSocket communication with an HTTP request that only has the `:authority` pseudo-header.
`HostHeaderCustomizer` synthesizes the `Host` HTTP header for such requests, so that WebSocket web applications that inspect the initial HTTP request before the WebSocket communication will work seamlessly in any HTTP protocol version.

For more information about how to configure `HostHeaderCustomizer`, see also link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/HostHeaderCustomizer.html[the javadocs].

[[pg-server-http-request-customizer-proxy]]
===== `ProxyCustomizer`

`ProxyCustomizer` should be added when Jetty receives requests from a reverse proxy on behalf of a remote client, prefixed by the PROXY protocol (see also this section about the xref:pg-server-http-connector-protocol-proxy-http11[PROXY protocol]).

`ProxyCustomizer` adds the reverse proxy IP address and port as `Request` attributes.
Web applications may use these attributes in conjunction with the data exposed by `ForwardedRequestCustomizer` (see xref:pg-server-http-request-customizer-forwarded[this section]).

For more information about how to configure `ProxyCustomizer`, see also link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ProxyCustomizer.html[the javadocs].

[[pg-server-http-request-customizer-rewrite]]
===== `RewriteCustomizer`

`RewriteCustomizer` is similar to `RewriteHandler` (see xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-rewrite[this section]), but a `RewriteCustomizer` cannot send a response or otherwise complete the request/response processing.

A `RewriteCustomizer` is mostly useful if you want to rewrite the request URI _before_ the `Handler` chain is invoked.
However, a very similar effect can be achieved by having the `RewriteHandler` as the first `Handler` (the child `Handler` of the `Server` instance).

Since `RewriteCustomizer` cannot send a response or complete the request/response processing, ``Rule``s that do so such as redirect rules have no effect and are ignored; only ``Rule``s that modify or wrap the `Request` will have effect and be applied.

Due to this limitation, it is often a better choice to use `RewriteHandler` instead of `RewriteCustomizer`.

For more information about how to configure `RewriteCustomizer`, see also link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/rewrite/RewriteCustomizer.html[the javadocs].

[[pg-server-http-request-customizer-secure]]
===== `SecureRequestCustomizer`

`SecureRequestCustomizer` should be added when Jetty receives requests over a secure `Connector`.

`SecureRequestCustomizer` adds TLS information as request attributes, in particular an instance of `EndPoint.SslSessionData` that contains information about the negotiated TLS cipher suite and possibly client certificates, and an instance of `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.X509` that contains information about the server certificate.

`SecureRequestCustomizer` also adds, if configured so, the `Strict-Transport-Security` HTTP response header (for more information about this header, see link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6797[its specification]).

For more information about how to configure `SecureRequestCustomizer`, see also link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/SecureRequestCustomizer.html[the javadocs].
