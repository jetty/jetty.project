===== HTTP Session Support

Some web applications (but not all of them) have the concept of a _user_, that is a way to identify a specific client that is interacting with the web application.

The HTTP session is a feature offered by servers that allows web applications to maintain a temporary, per-user, storage for user-specific data.

The storage can be accessed by the web application across multiple request/response interactions with the client.
This makes the web application stateful, because a computation performed by a previous request may be stored in the HTTP session and used in subsequent requests without the need to perform again the computation.

Since not all web applications need support for the HTTP session, Jetty offers this feature optionally.

The Maven coordinates for the Jetty HTTP session support are:

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-session</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The HTTP session support is provided by the `org.eclipse.jetty.session.SessionHandler`, that must be set up in the `Handler` tree between a `ContextHandler` and your `Handler` implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/SessionHandlerDocs.java[tags=session]
----

The corresponding `Handler` tree structure looks like the following:

[source,screen]
----
Server
└── ContextHandler /myApp
    └── SessionHandler
        └── MyAppHandler
----

With the ``Handler``s set up in this way, you can access the HTTP session from your `MyAppHandler` using `Request.getSession(boolean)`, and then use the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/Session.html[`Session` APIs].

The support provided by Jetty for HTTP sessions is advanced and completely pluggable, providing features such as first-level and second-level caching, eviction, etc.

You can configure the HTTP session support from a very simple local in-memory configuration, to a replicated (across nodes in a cluster), persistent (for example over file system, database or link:https://memcached.org/[memcached]) configuration for the most advanced use cases.
The advanced configuration of Jetty's HTTP session support is discussed in more details in xref:pg-server-session[this section].
