=== HTTP Server Libraries

Web application development typically involves writing your web applications, packaging them into a web application archive, the `+*.war+` file, and then deploy the `+*.war+` file into a standalone Servlet Container that you have previously installed.

The Eclipse Jetty server libraries allow you to write web applications components using either the Jetty APIs (by writing xref:pg-server-http-handler[Jetty ``Handler``s]) or using the standard xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet[Servlet APIs] (by writing ``Servlet``s and Servlet ``Filter``s).
These components can then be programmatically assembled together, without the need of creating a `+*.war+` file, added to a Jetty ``Server`` instance that is then started.
This result in your web applications to be available to HTTP clients as if you deployed your `+*.war+` files in a standalone Jetty server.

The Maven artifact coordinates are:

  <artifactId>jetty-server</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>

An `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server` instance is the central component that links together a collection of ``Connector``s and a collection of ``Handler``s, with threads from a `ThreadPool` doing the work.

The components that accept connections from clients are `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Connector` implementations.

When a Jetty server interprets the HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3), it uses `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler` instances to process incoming requests and eventually produce responses.

A `Server` must be created, configured and started:

----

The example above shows the simplest HTTP/1.1 server; it has no support for HTTP sessions, for HTTP authentication, or for any of the features required by the Servlet specification.

All these features are provided by the Jetty Server Libraries, and server applications only need to put the required components together to provide all the required features.

The ``Handler``s provided by the Jetty Server Libraries allow writing server applications that have functionalities similar to Apache HTTPD or Nginx (for example: URL redirection, URL rewriting, serving static content, reverse proxying, etc.), as well as generating content dynamically by processing incoming requests.
Read xref:pg-server-http-handler[this section] for further details about ``Handler``s.

If you are interested in writing your server application based on the Servlet APIs, jump to xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet[this section].

[[pg-server-http-request-processing]]
==== Request Processing

The Jetty HTTP request processing is outlined below in the diagram below.
You may want to refer to the xref:pg-arch-io[Jetty I/O architecture] for additional information about the classes mentioned below.

Request handing is slightly different for each protocol; in HTTP/2 Jetty takes into account multiplexing, something that is not present in HTTP/1.1.

However, the diagram below captures the essence of request handling that is common among all protocols that carry HTTP requests.

Connection -> EndPoint : fill()
EndPoint --> Connection
Connection -> Parser : parse()
Parser -> HttpChannel : events
Connection -> HttpChannel : handle()
HttpChannel -> Server : handle()
Server -> Handlers : handle()
----

First, the Jetty I/O layer emits an event that a socket has data to read.
This event is converted to a call to `AbstractConnection.onFillable()`, where the `Connection` first reads from the `EndPoint` into a `ByteBuffer`, and then calls a protocol specific parser to parse the bytes in the `ByteBuffer`.

The parser emit events that are protocol specific; the HTTP/2 parser, for example, emits events for each HTTP/2 frame that has been parsed, and similarly does the HTTP/3 parser.
The parser events are then converted to protocol independent events such as _"request start"_, _"request headers"_, _"request content chunk"_, etc.
that in turn are converted into method calls to `HttpChannel`.

When enough of the HTTP request is arrived, the `Connection` calls `HttpChannel.handle()` that calls the `Handler` chain, that eventually calls the server application code.

[[pg-server-http-channel-events]]
===== HttpChannel Events

The central component processing HTTP requests is `HttpChannel`.
There is a 1-to-1 relationship between an HTTP request/response and an `HttpChannel`, no matter what is the specific protocol that carries the HTTP request over the network (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 or FastCGI).

Advanced server applications may be interested in the progress of the processing of an HTTP request/response by `HttpChannel`.
A typical case is to know exactly _when_ the HTTP request/response processing is complete, for example to monitor processing times.

NOTE: A `Handler` or a Servlet `Filter` may not report precisely when an HTTP request/response processing is finished.
A server application may write a small enough content that is aggregated by Jetty for efficiency reasons; the write returns immediately, but nothing has been written to the network yet.

`HttpChannel` notifies ``HttpChannel.Listener``s of the progress of the HTTP request/response handling.
Currently, the following events are available:

* `requestBegin`
* `beforeDispatch`
* `dispatchFailure`
* `afterDispatch`
* `requestContent`
* `requestContentEnd`
* `requestTrailers`
* `requestEnd`
* `responseBegin`
* `responseCommit`
* `responseContent`
* `responseFailure`
* `responseEnd`
* `complete`

Please refer to the `HttpChannel.Listener` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/HttpChannel.Listener.html[javadocs] for the complete list of events.

Server applications can register `HttpChannel.Listener` by adding them as xref:pg-arch-bean[beans] to the `Connector`:

[[pg-server-http-request-logging]]
==== Request Logging

HTTP requests and responses can be logged to provide data that can be later analyzed with other tools.
These tools can provide information such as the most frequently accessed request URIs, the response status codes, the request/response content lengths, geographical information about the clients, etc.

The default request/response log line format is the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format[NCSA Format] extended with referrer data and user-agent data.

[NOTE]
====
Typically, the extended NCSA format is the is enough and it's the standard used and understood by most log parsing tools and monitoring tools.

To customize the request/response log line format see the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/CustomRequestLog.html[`CustomRequestLog` javadocs].
====

Request logging can be enabled at the server level, or at the web application context level.

The request logging output can be directed to an SLF4J logger named `"org.eclipse.jetty.server.RequestLog"` at `INFO` level, and therefore to any logging library implementation of your choice (see also xref:pg-troubleshooting-logging[this section] about logging).

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=serverRequestLogSLF4J]
----

Alternatively, the request logging output can be directed to a daily rolling file of your choice, and the file name must contain `yyyy_MM_dd` so that rolled over files retain their date:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=serverRequestLogFile]
----

For maximum flexibility, you can log to multiple ``RequestLog``s using class `RequestLog.Collection`, for example by logging with different formats or to different outputs.

You can use `CustomRequestLog` with a custom `RequestLog.Writer` to direct the request logging output to your custom targets (for example, an RDBMS).
You can implement your own `RequestLog` if you want to have functionalities that are not implemented by `CustomRequestLog`.

Request logging can also be enabled at the web application context level, using `RequestLogHandler` (see xref:pg-server-http-handler[this section] about how to organize Jetty ``Handler``s) to wrap a web application `Handler`:
