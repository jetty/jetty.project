=== HTTP Server Libraries

Web application development typically involves writing your web applications, packaging them into a web application archive, the `+*.war+` file, and then deploy the `+*.war+` file into a standalone Servlet Container that you have previously installed.

The Jetty server libraries allow you to write web applications components using either the Jetty APIs (by writing xref:pg-server-http-handler[Jetty ``Handler``s]) or using the standard xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet[Servlet APIs] (by writing ``Servlet``s and Servlet ``Filter``s).
These components can then be programmatically assembled together, without the need of creating a `+*.war+` file, added to a Jetty ``Server`` instance that is then started.
This result in your web applications to be available to HTTP clients as if you deployed your `+*.war+` files in a standalone Jetty server.

Jetty `Handler` APIs pros:

* Simple minimalist asynchronous APIs.
* Very low overhead, only configure the features you use.
* Faster turnaround to implement new APIs or new standards.
* Normal classloading behavior (web application classloading isolation also available).

Servlet APIs pros:

* Standard, well known, APIs.

An `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server` instance is the central component that links together a collection of ``Connector``s and a collection of ``Handler``s, with threads from a `ThreadPool` doing the work.

The components that accept connections from clients are `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Connector` implementations.

When a Jetty server interprets the HTTP protocol (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or HTTP/3), it uses `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Handler` instances to process incoming requests and eventually produce responses.

A `Server` must be created, configured and started:

[source,java,indent=0]

include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/http/HTTPServerDocs.java[tags=simple]
----

The example above shows the simplest HTTP/1.1 server; it has no support for HTTP sessions, nor for HTTP authentication, nor for any of the features required by the Servlet specification.

These features (HTTP session support, HTTP authentication support, etc.) are provided by the Jetty server libraries, but not all of them may be necessary in your web application.
You need to put together the required Jetty components to provide the features required by your web applications.
The advantage is that you do not pay the cost for features that you do not use, saving resources and likely increasing performance.

The built-in ``Handler``s provided by the Jetty server libraries allow you to write web applications that have functionalities similar to Apache HTTPD or Nginx (for example: URL redirection, URL rewriting, serving static content, reverse proxying, etc.), as well as generating content dynamically by processing incoming requests.
Read xref:pg-server-http-handler[this section] for further details about ``Handler``s.

If you are interested in writing your web application based on the Servlet APIs, jump to xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet[this section].

==== Request Processing

The Jetty HTTP request processing is outlined below in the diagram below.
You may want to refer to the xref:pg-arch-io[Jetty I/O architecture] for additional information about the classes mentioned below.

Request handing is slightly different for each protocol; in HTTP/2 Jetty takes into account multiplexing, something that is not present in HTTP/1.1.

However, the diagram below captures the essence of request handling that is common among all protocols that carry HTTP requests.

participant ManagedSelector
participant EndPoint
participant Connection
participant Parser
participant HttpStream
participant HttpChannel
participant Server
participant Handlers

ManagedSelector -> EndPoint : read ready
EndPoint -> Connection : onFillable()
Connection -> EndPoint : fill()
EndPoint --> Connection
Connection -> Parser : parse()
Parser -> HttpStream : events
Connection -> HttpChannel : onRequest()
HttpChannel -> Server : handle()
Server -> Handlers : handle()
----

First, the Jetty I/O layer emits an event that a socket has data to read.
This event is converted to a call to `AbstractConnection.onFillable()`, where the `Connection` first reads from the `EndPoint` into a `ByteBuffer`, and then calls a protocol specific parser to parse the bytes in the `ByteBuffer`.

The parser emit events that are protocol specific; the HTTP/2 parser, for example, emits events for each HTTP/2 frame that has been parsed, and similarly does the HTTP/3 parser.
The parser events are then converted to protocol independent events such as _"request start"_, _"request headers"_, _"request content chunk"_, etc. detailed in xref:pg-server-http-request-processing-events[this section].

When enough of the HTTP request is arrived, the `Connection` calls `HttpChannel.onRequest()`.

`HttpChannel.onRequest()` calls the xref:pg-server-http-request-customizers[request customizers], that allow to customize the request and/or the response headers on a per-``Connector`` basis.

After request customization, if any, the `Handler` chain is invoked, starting from the `Server` instance, and eventually your web application code is invoked.

[[pg-server-http-request-processing-events]]
===== Request Processing Events

Advanced web applications may be interested in the progress of the processing of an HTTP request/response.
A typical case is to know exactly _when_ the HTTP request/response processing starts and when it is complete, for example to monitor processing times.

This is conveniently implemented by `org.eclipse.jetty.server.handler.EventsHandler`, described in more details in xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-events[this section].
