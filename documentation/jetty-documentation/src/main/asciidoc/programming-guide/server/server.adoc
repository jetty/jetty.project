== Server Libraries

The Eclipse Jetty Project provides server-side libraries that allow you to configure and start programmatically an HTTP or WebSocket server from a main class, or embed it in your existing application.
A typical example is a HTTP server that needs to expose a REST endpoint.
Another example is a proxy application that receives HTTP requests, processes them, and then forwards them to third party services, for example using the Jetty xref:pg-client[client libraries].

While historically Jetty is an HTTP server, it is possible to use the Jetty server-side libraries to write a generic network server that interprets any network protocol (not only HTTP).
If you are interested in the low-level details of how the Eclipse Jetty server libraries work, or are interested in writing a custom protocol, look at the xref:pg-server-io-arch[Server I/O Architecture].

The Jetty server-side libraries provide:

* HTTP support for HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, clear-text or encrypted, HTTP/3, for applications that want to embed Jetty as a generic HTTP server or proxy, via the xref:pg-server-http[HTTP libraries]
* HTTP/2 low-level support, for applications that want to explicitly handle low-level HTTP/2 _sessions_, _streams_ and _frames_, via the xref:pg-server-http2[HTTP/2 libraries]
* HTTP/3 low-level support, for applications that want to explicitly handle low-level HTTP/3 _sessions_, _streams_ and _frames_, via the xref:pg-server-http3[HTTP/3 libraries]
* WebSocket support, for applications that want to embed a WebSocket server, via the xref:pg-server-websocket[WebSocket libraries]
* FCGI support, to delegate requests to python or similar scripting languages.
