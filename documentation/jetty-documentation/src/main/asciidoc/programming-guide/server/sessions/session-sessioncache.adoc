==== The SessionCache

There is one `SessionCache` per `SessionHandler`, and thus one per context.
Its purpose is to provide an L1 cache of `Session` objects.
Having a working set of `Session` objects in memory allows multiple simultaneous requests for the same session to share the same `Session` object.
A `SessionCache` uses a `SessionDataStore` to create, read, store and delete the `SessionData` associated with the `Session`.

There are two ways to create a `SessionCache` for a `SessionHandler`:

. allow the `SessionHandler` to create one lazily at startup.
The `SessionHandler` looks for a `SessionCacheFactory` bean on the server to produce the `SessionCache` instance.
It then looks for a `SessionDataStoreFactory` bean on the server to produce a `SessionDataStore` instance to use with the `SessionCache`.

. pass a fully configured `SessionCache` instance to the `SessionHandler`.
You are responsible for configuring both the `SessionCache` instance and its `SessionDataStore` 

More on ``SessionDataStore``s xref:pg-server-session-datastore[later], in this section we will concentrate on the `SessionCache` and `SessionCacheFactory`.


The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/AbstractSessionCache.html[AbstractSessionCache] provides most of the behaviour of ``SessionCache``s.
If you are implementing a custom `SessionCache` we strongly recommend you extend this base class, as the Servlet Specification has many subtleties and extending the base class ensures that your implementation will take account of them.

Some of the important behaviours of ``SessionCache``s are:

eviction::
By default, sessions remain in a cache until they are expired or invalidated.
If you have many or large sessions that are infrequently referenced you can use eviction to reduce the memory consumed by the cache.
When a session is evicted, it is removed from the cache but it is _not_ invalidated.
If you have configured a `SessionDataStore` that persists or distributes the session in some way, it will continue to exist, and can be read back in when it needs to be referenced again.
The eviction strategies are:
    NEVER_EVICT:::
    This is the default, sessions remain in the cache until expired or invalidated.
    EVICT_ON_SESSION_EXIT:::
    When the last simultaneous request for a session finishes, the session will be evicted from the cache.
    EVICT_ON_INACTIVITY:::
    If a session has not been referenced for a configurable number of seconds, then it will be evicted from the cache.

saveOnInactiveEviction::
This controls whether a session will be persisted to the `SessionDataStore` if it is being evicted due to the EVICT_ON_INACTIVITY policy.
Usually sessions are written to the `SessionDataStore` whenever the last simultaneous request exits the session.
However, as `SessionDataStores` can be configured to xref:pg-server-session-datastore-skip[skip some writes], this option ensures that the session will be written out.

saveOnCreate::
Usually a session will be written through to the configured `SessionDataStore` when the last request for it finishes.
In the case of a freshly created session, this means that it will not be persisted until the request is fully finished.
If your application uses context forwarding or including, the newly created session id will not be available in the subsequent contexts.
You can enable this feature to ensure that a freshly created session is immediately persisted after creation: in this way the session id will be available for use in other contexts accessed during the same request.

removeUnloadableSessions::
If a session becomes corrupted in the persistent store, it cannot be re-loaded into the `SessionCache`.
This can cause noisy log output during scavenge cycles, when the same corrupted session fails to load over and over again.
To prevent his, enable this feature and the `SessionCache` will ensure that if a session fails to be loaded, it will be deleted.

invalidateOnShutdown::
Some applications want to ensure that all cached sessions are removed when the server shuts down.
This option will ensure that all cached sessions are invalidated.
The `AbstractSessionCache` does not implement this behaviour, a subclass must implement the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionCache.html#shutdown()[SessionCache.shutdown()] method.

flushOnResponseCommit::
This forces a "dirty" session to be written to the `SessionDataStore` just before a response is returned to the client, rather than waiting until the request is finished.
A "dirty" session is one whose attributes have changed, or it has been freshly created.
Using this option ensures that all subsequent requests - either to the same or a different node - will see the latest changes to the session.

Jetty provides two `SessionCache` implementations: the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCache.html[DefaultSessionCache] and the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/NullSessionCache.html[NullSessionCache].

[[pg-server-session-hash]]
===== The DefaultSessionCache

The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCache.html[DefaultSessionCache] retains `Session` objects in memory in a `ConcurrentHashMap`.
It is suitable for non-clustered and clustered deployments.
For clustered deployments, a sticky load balancer is *strongly* recommended, otherwise you risk indeterminate session state as the session bounces around multiple nodes.

It implements the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionCache.html#shutdown()[SessionCache.shutdown()] method.

It also provides some statistics on sessions, which are convenient to access either directly in code or remotely via jmx:

current sessions::
The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCache.html#getSessionsCurrent()[DefaultSessionCache.getSessionsCurrent()] reports the number of sessions in the cache at the time of the method call.

max sessions::
The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCache.html#getSessionsCurrent()[DefaultSessionCache.getSessionsMax()] reports the highest number of sessions in the cache at the time of the method call.


total sessions::
The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCache.html#getSessionsTotal()[DefaultSessionCache.getSessionsTotal()] reports the cumulative total of the number of sessions in the cache at the time of the method call.

reset::
The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCache.html#resetStats()[DefaultSessionCache.resetStats()] zeros out the statistics counters.

If you create a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionCacheFactory.html[DefaultSessionFactory] and register it as `Server` bean, a `SessionHandler` will be able to lazily create a `DefaultSessionCache`.
The `DefaultSessionCacheFactory` has all of the same configuration setters as a `DefaultSessionCache`.
Alternatively, if you only have a single `SessionHandler`, or you need to configure a `DefaultSessionCache` differently for every `SessionHandler`, then you could dispense with the `DefaultSessionCacheFactory` and simply instantiate, configure and pass in the `DefaultSessionCache` yourself.

----

NOTE: If you don't configure any `SessionCache` or `SessionCacheFactory`, the `SessionHandler` will automatically create a `DefaultSessionCache`.
 
[[pg-server-session-null]]
===== The NullSessionCache

The link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/NullSessionCache.html[NullSessionCache] does not actually cache any objects: each request uses a fresh `Session` object.
It is suitable for clustered deployments without a sticky load balancer and non-clustered deployments when purely minimal support for sessions is needed.

As no sessions are actually cached, of course functions like `invalidateOnShutdown` and all of the eviction strategies have no meaning for the `NullSessionCache`.

There is a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/NullSessionCacheFactory.html[NullSessionCacheFactory] which you can instantiate, configure and set as a `Server` bean to enable the `SessionHandler` to automatically create new ``NullCache``s as needed.
All of the same configuration options are available on the `NullSessionCacheFactory` as the `NullSessionCache` itself.
Alternatively, if you only have a single `SessionHandler`, or you need to configure a `NullSessionCache` differently for every `SessionHandler`, then you could dispense with the `NullSessionCacheFactory` and simply instantiate, configure and pass in the `NullSessionCache` yourself.

[[pg-server-session-customcache]]
===== Implementing a Custom SessionCache

As previously mentioned, we highly recommend that you extend the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/AbstractSessionCache.html[AbstractSessionCache].

===== Heterogeneous Caching

Using one of the ``SessionCacheFactory``s will ensure that every time a `SessionHandler` starts it will create a new instance of the corresponding type of `SessionCache`.

But, what if you deploy multiple webapps, and for one of them, you don't want to use sessions?
Or alternatively, you don't want to use sessions, but you have one webapp that now needs them?
In that case, you can configure the `SessionCacheFactory` appropriate to the majority, and then specifically create the right type of `SessionCache` for the others.
Here's an example where we configure the `DefaultSessionCacheFactory` to handle most webapps, but then specifically use a `NullSessionCache` for another:
