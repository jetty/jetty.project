===== The FileSessionDataStore

The `FileSessionDataStore` supports persistent storage of session data in a filesystem.

IMPORTANT: Persisting sessions to the local file system should *never* be used in a clustered environment.

One file represents one session in one context.

File names follow this pattern:

 [expiry]_[contextpath]_[virtualhost]_[id]

expiry::
This is the expiry time in milliseconds since the epoch.

contextpath::
This is the context path with any special characters, including `/`, replaced by the `_` underscore character.
For example, a context path of `/catalog` would become `_catalog`.
A context path of simply `/` becomes just `__`.

virtualhost::
This is the first virtual host associated with the context and has the form of 4 digits separated by `.` characters.
If there are no virtual hosts associated with a context, then `0.0.0.0` is used:

  [digit].[digit].[digit].[digit]
  
id::
This is the unique id of the session.

Putting all of the above together as an example, a session with an id of `node0ek3vx7x2y1e7pmi3z00uqj1k0` for the context with path `/test` with no virtual hosts and an expiry of `1599558193150` would have a file name of:

`1599558193150__test_0.0.0.0_node0ek3vx7x2y1e7pmi3z00uqj1k0`


You can configure either a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/session/FileSessionDataStore.html[FileSessionDataStore] individually, or a `FileSessionDataStoreFactory` if you want multiple ``SessionHandler``s to use ``FileSessionDataStore``s that are identically configured.
The configuration methods are:

setStoreDir(File) _[Default:null]_ ::
This is the location for storage of session files.
If the directory does not exist at startup, it will be created.
If you use the same `storeDir` for multiple `SessionHandlers`, then the sessions for all of those contexts are stored in the same directory.
This is not a problem, as the name of the file is unique because it contains the context information.
You _must_ supply a value for this, otherwise startup of the `FileSessionDataStore` will fail.

deleteUnrestorableFiles(boolean) _[Default:false]_ ::

If set to `true`, unreadable files will be deleted.
This is useful to prevent repeated logging of the same error when the xref:pg-server-session-housekeeper[scavenger] periodically (re-)attempts to load the corrupted information for a session in order to expire it.

Here's an example of configuring a `FileSessionDataStoreFactory`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/session/SessionDocs.java[tags=filesessiondatastorefactory]
----

Here's an alternate example, configuring a `FileSessionDataStore` directly:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/session/SessionDocs.java[tags=filesessiondatastore]
