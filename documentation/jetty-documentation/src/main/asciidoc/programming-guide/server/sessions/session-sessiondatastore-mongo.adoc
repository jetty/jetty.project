===== The MongoSessionDataStore

The `MongoSessionDataStore` supports persistence of `SessionData` in a nosql database.

The best description for the document model for session information is found in the javadoc for the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/session/mongodb/MongoSessionDataStore.html[MongoSessionDataStore].
In overview, it can be represented thus:

[plantuml]
----
database HttpSessions {
  folder jettySessions {
    file session {
      file "context" {
        rectangle attributes
      }
    }
  }
}
----

The database contains a document collection for the sessions.
Each document represents a session id, and contains one nested document per context in which that session id is used.
For example, the session id `abcd12345` might be used by two contexts, one with path `/contextA` and one with path `/contextB`.
In that case, the outermost document would refer to `abcd12345` and it would have a nested document for `/contextA` containing the session attributes for that context, and another nested document for `/contextB` containing the session attributes for that context.
Remember, according to the Servlet Specification, a session id can be shared by many contexts, but the attributes must be unique per context.

The outermost document contains these fields:

id::
The session id.
created::
The time (in ms since the epoch) at which the session was first created in any context.
maxIdle::
The time (in ms) for which an idle session is regarded as valid.
As maxIdle times can be different for ``Session``s from different contexts, this is the _shortest_ maxIdle time.
expiry::
The time (in ms since the epoch) at which the session will expire.
As the expiry time can be different for ``Session``s from different contexts, this is the _shortest_ expiry time.

Each nested context-specific document contains:

attributes::
The session attributes as a serialized map.
lastSaved::
The time (in ms since the epoch) at which the session in this context was saved.
lastAccessed::
The time (in ms since the epoch) at which the session in this context was previously accessed.
accessed::
The time (in ms since the epoch) at which this session was most recently accessed.
lastNode::
The xref:pg-server-session-workername[workerName] of the last server that saved the session data.
version::
An object that is updated every time a session is written out for a context.

====== Configuration

You can configure either a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/session/mongodb/MongoSessionDataStore.html[MongoSessionDataStore] individually, or a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/session/mongodb/MongoSessionDataStore.html[MongoSessionDataStoreFactory] if you want multiple ``SessionHandler``s to use ``MongoSessionDataStore``s that are identically configured.
The configuration methods for the `MongoSessionDataStoreFactory` are:

include::session-sessiondatastore.adoc[tag=common-datastore-config]

dbName::
This is the name of the database.
collectionName::
The name of the document collection.

There are two alternative ways to specify the connection to mongodb:

connectionString::
This is a mongodb url, eg `mongodb://localhost`
host::
port::
This is the hostname and port number of the mongodb instance to contact.

Let's look at an example of configuring a `MongoSessionDataStoreFactory`:
