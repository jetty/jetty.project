==== The SessionIdManager

There is a maximum of one `SessionIdManager` per `Server` instance.
Its purpose is to generate fresh, unique session ids and to coordinate the re-use of session ids amongst co-operating contexts.

The `SessionIdManager` is agnostic with respect to the type of clustering technology chosen.

Jetty provides a default implementation - the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/DefaultSessionIdManager.html[DefaultSessionIdManager]  - which should meet the needs of most users.

NOTE: If you do not explicitly configure a `SessionIdManager`, then when the `SessionHandler` starts, it will use an instance of the `DefaultSessionIdManager`.

[[pg-server-session-defaultidmgr]]
===== The DefaultSessionIdManager

At startup, if no instance of the `HouseKeeper` has been explicitly set, the `DefaultSessionIdManager` will create one.

[[pg-server-session-workername]]
Also at startup, the `workerName` is determined. 
The `workerName` must be unique per `Server`, and identifies the server in a cluster.
If a `workerName` has not been explicitly set, then the value is derived as follows:

+node[JETTY_WORKER_NAME]+

where `JETTY_WORKER_NAME` is an environment variable whose value can be an integer or string.
If the environment variable is not set, then it defaults to `0`, yielding the default `workerName` of `"node0"`.

The `DefaultSessionIdManager` uses `SecureRandom` to generate unique session ids.

The `SessionHandler` class, which is used by both the `ServletContextHandler` and the `WebAppContext` classes, will instantiate a `DefaultSessionIdManager` on startup if it does not detect one already present for the `Server`.

Here is an example of explicitly setting up a `DefaultSessionIdManager` with a `workerName` of `server3` in code:

==== Implementing a Custom SessionIdManager

If the `DefaultSessionIdManager` does not meet your needs, you can extend it, or implement the `SessionIdManager` interface directly.

When implementing a `SessionIdManager` pay particular attention to the following:

* the `getWorkerName()` method _must_ return a name that is unique to the `Server` instance.
The `workerName` becomes important in clustering scenarios because sessions can migrate from node to node:  the `workerName` identifies which node was last managing a `Session`.
* the contract of the `isIdInUse(String id)` method is very specific: a session id may _only_ be reused _iff_ it is already in use by another context.
This restriction is important to support cross-context dispatch.
* you should be _very_ careful to ensure that the `newSessionId(HttpServletRequest request, long created)` method does not return duplicate or predictable session ids.

[[pg-server-session-housekeeper]]
===== The HouseKeeper

There is a maximum of one link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/HouseKeeper.html[HouseKeeper] per `SessionIdManager`.
Its purpose is to periodically poll the link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/session/SessionHandler.html[SessionHandlers] to clean out expired sessions.
This operation is usually referred to as "scavenging" expired sessions.
The scavenging interval is configured by the `setIntervalSec(long)` method.
The default value is ``600``sec, ie ``10``mins.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The HouseKeeper semi-randomly adds an additional `10%` of the configured `intervalSec`.
This is to help prevent sync-ing up of servers in a cluster that are all restarted at once, and slightly stagger their scavenge cycles to ensure any load on the persistent storage mechanism is spread out.
