==== Jetty APIs Implementation

When you write a WebSocket application using the Jetty WebSocket APIs, your code typically need to depend on just the Jetty WebSocket APIs to compile your application.
However, at runtime you need to have the _implementation_ of the Jetty WebSocket APIs in your class-path (or module-path).

Jetty's WebSocket APIs are provided by the following Maven artifact:

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.websocket</groupId>
  <artifactId>websocket-jetty-api</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Jetty's implementation of the Jetty WebSocket APIs is provided by the following Maven artifact (and its transitive dependencies):

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.websocket</groupId>
  <artifactId>websocket-jetty-server</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
The `websocket-jetty-api` artifact and the `websocket-jetty-server` artifact (and its transitive dependencies) should be present in the server class-path (or module-path), and never in the web application's `/WEB-INF/lib` directory.
====

To configure correctly your WebSocket application based on the Jetty WebSocket APIs, you need two steps:

. Make sure that Jetty xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-container[sets up] an instance of `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`.
. Use the `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` APIs in your applications to xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints[register your WebSocket endpoints] that implement your application logic.

You can read more about the xref:pg-websocket-architecture[Jetty WebSocket architecture], which is common to both client-side and server-side, to get familiar with the terminology used in the following sections.

[[pg-server-websocket-jetty-container]]
===== Setting up `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`

Jetty sets up a `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` instance using `JettyWebSocketServletContainerInitializer`.

When you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context[`WebAppContext`], then  `JettyWebSocketServletContainerInitializer` is automatically discovered and initialized by Jetty when the web application starts, so that it sets up the `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`.
In this way, you do not need to write any additional code:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=standardContainerWebAppContext]
----

On the other hand, when you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context[`ServletContextHandler`], you have to write the code to ensure that the `JettyWebSocketServletContainerInitializer` is initialized, so that it sets up the `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyContainerServletContextHandler]
----

Calling `JettyWebSocketServletContainerInitializer.configure(\...)` must be done _before_ the `ServletContextHandler` is started, and configures the Jetty WebSocket implementation for that web application context.

[[pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints]]
===== Configuring Endpoints

Once you have xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-container[setup] the `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`, you can configure your xref:pg-websocket-endpoints[WebSocket endpoints].

Differently from the xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-endpoints[configuration of standard WebSocket endpoints], WebSocket endpoint classes may be annotated with Jetty WebSocket API annotations, or extend the `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.api.WebSocketListener` interface, but they are not automatically discovered, not even when deploying web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context[`WebAppContext`].

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using the Jetty WebSocket APIs, WebSocket endpoints must always be explicitly configured.
====

There are two ways of configuring WebSocket endpoints when using the Jetty WebSocket APIs:

* xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints-container[Using `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`], which is very similar to how WebSocket endpoints are configured when using the xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-endpoints[standard `javax.websocket` APIs], but also provides APIs to perform a direct, programmatic, WebSocket upgrade.
* xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints-servlet[Using `JettyWebSocketServlet`], which may configured in `web.xml`, rather than in Java code.

[[pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints-container]]
====== Using `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`

To register WebSocket endpoints using the Jetty WebSocket APIs you need to access the `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` APIs.

The `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` instance is stored in the `ServletContext`, so it can be retrieved when the `ServletContext` is initialized, either from a `ServletContextListener` or from a `HttpServlet`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyEndpointsInitialization]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyWebSocketInitializerServlet]
----

You can also use this variant to set up the `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` and configure the WebSocket endpoints in one step:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyContainerAndEndpoints]
----

In the call to `JettyWebSocketServerContainer.addMapping(\...)`, you can specify a _path spec_ (the first parameter) that can be configured as specified in xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-pathspec[this section].

When the `ServletContextHandler` is started, the `Configurator` lambda (the second parameter passed to `JettyWebSocketServletContainerInitializer.configure(\...)`) is invoked and allows you to explicitly configure the WebSocket endpoints using the Jetty WebSocket APIs provided by `JettyWebSocketServerContainer`.

Under the hood, the call to `JettyWebSocketServerContainer.addMapping(\...)` installs the `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.servlet.WebSocketUpgradeFilter`, which is the component that intercepts HTTP requests to upgrade to WebSocket, described in xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-upgrade[this section].
For more information about the configuration of `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` see also xref:pg-server-websocket-configure-filter[this section].

One last alternative to register your WebSocket endpoints is to use a programmatic WebSocket upgrade via `JettyWebSocketServerContainer.upgrade(\...)`, which allows you to use a standard `HttpServlet` subclass (rather than a `JettyWebSocketServlet` as explained in xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints-servlet[this section]) to perform a direct WebSocket upgrade when your application logic demands so:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyContainerServletContextHandler]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyContainerUpgrade]
----

When using `JettyWebSocketServerContainer.upgrade(\...)`, the `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` is not installed, since the WebSocket upgrade is performed programmatically.

[[pg-server-websocket-jetty-endpoints-servlet]]
====== Using `JettyWebSocketServlet`

An alternative way to register WebSocket endpoints using the Jetty WebSocket APIs is to use a `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass (or even many different `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclasses).

This method has the advantage that it does not install the `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` under the hood, because the WebSocket upgrade is handled directly by your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass.
This may also have a performance benefit for non-WebSocket HTTP requests (as they will not pass through the `WebSocketUpgradeFilter`).

Your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass may be declared and configured either in code or in `web.xml`.
Declaring your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass explicitly in code or in `web.xml` also simplifies the declaration and configuration of other web components such as other Servlets and/or Filters (for example, it is easier to configure the `CrossOriginFilter`, see also xref:pg-server-websocket-configure-filter[this section] for more information).

For example, your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass may be declared in code in this way:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyWebSocketServletMain]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=jettyWebSocketServlet]
----

Note how in the call to `JettyWebSocketServletContainerInitializer.configure(\...)` the second parameter is `null`, because WebSocket endpoints are not created here, but instead by one (or more) `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclasses.
Yet the call is necessary to create other WebSocket implementation components that are necessary also when using `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclasses.

An HTTP upgrade request to WebSocket that matches your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass path mapping (specified above via `ServletContextHandler.addServlet(\...)`) arrives at the Servlet and is inspected to verify whether it is a valid upgrade to WebSocket.

If the HTTP request is a valid upgrade to WebSocket, `JettyWebSocketServlet` calls `configure(JettyWebSocketServletFactory factory)` that you have overridden in your subclass, so that your application can instantiate and return the WebSocket endpoint.
After having obtained the WebSocket endpoint, `JettyWebSocketServlet` performs the WebSocket upgrade.
From this point on, the communication happens with the WebSocket protocol, and HTTP components such as Filters and Servlets are not relevant anymore.

If the HTTP request is not an upgrade to WebSocket, `JettyWebSocketServlet` delegates the processing to the superclass, `javax.servlet.HttpServlet`, which in turn invokes methods such as `doGet(\...)` or `doPost(\...)` depending on the HTTP method.
If your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass did not override the `doXYZ(\...)` method corresponding to the HTTP request, a `405 Method Not Allowed` response is returned to the client, as per the standard `HttpServlet` class implementation.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to use both `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` and `JettyWebSocketServlet`.

However, it is typically best to avoid mixing the use of `JettyWebSocketServerContainer` with the use of `JettyWebSocketServlet`, so that all your WebSocket endpoints are initialized by the same code in one place only.
====

Using `JettyWebSocketServerContainer.addMapping(\...)` will install the `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` under the hood, which by default will intercepts all HTTP requests to upgrade to WebSocket.
However, as explained in xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-upgrade[this section], if `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` does not find a matching WebSocket endpoint for the request URI path, then the HTTP request is passed to the Filter chain of your web application and may arrive to your `JettyWebSocketServlet` subclass, where it would be processed and possibly result in a WebSocket upgrade.

[[pg-server-websocket-jetty-pathspec]]
====== Custom PathSpec Mappings

The `JettyWebSocketServerContainer.addMapping(\...)` API maps a _path spec_ to a `JettyWebSocketCreator` instance (typically a lambda expression).
The path spec is matched against the WebSocket upgrade request URI to select the correspondent `JettyWebSocketCreator` to invoke.

The path spec can have these forms:

* Servlet syntax, specified with `servlet|<path spec>`, where the `servlet|` prefix can be omitted if the path spec begins with `/` or `+*.+` (for example, `/ws`, `/ws/chat` or `+*.ws+`).
* Regex syntax, specified with `regex|<path spec>`, where the `regex|` prefix can be omitted if the path spec begins with `^` (for example, `+^/ws/[0-9]++`).
* URI template syntax, specified with `uri-template|<path spec>` (for example `+uri-template|/ws/chat/{room}+`).

Within the `JettyWebSocketCreator`, it is possible to access the path spec and, for example in case of URI templates, extract additional information in the following way:
