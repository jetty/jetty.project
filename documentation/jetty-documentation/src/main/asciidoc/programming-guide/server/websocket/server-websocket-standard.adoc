[[pg-server-websocket-standard]]
==== Standard APIs Implementation

When you write a WebSocket application using the standard `javax.websocket` APIs, your code typically need to depend on just the APIs to compile your application.
However, at runtime you need to have an implementation of the standard APIs in your class-path (or module-path).

The standard `javax.websocket` APIs are provided by the following Maven artifact:

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.websocket</groupId>
  <artifactId>javax.websocket-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

However, the artifact above lacks a proper JPMS `module-info.class` file, and therefore it is a little more difficult to use if you want to use of JPMS for your application.

If you want to use JPMS for your application, you can use this Maven artifact instead:

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.toolchain</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-javax-websocket-api</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.2</version>
</dependency>
----

This artifact is nothing more than the `javax.websocket:javax.websocket-api:1.1` artifact repackaged with a proper `module-info.class` file.

At runtime, you also need an implementation of the standard `javax.websocket` APIs.

Jetty's implementation of the standard `javax.websocket` APIs is provided by the following Maven artifact (and its transitive dependencies):

[source,xml,subs=normal]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.websocket</groupId>
  <artifactId>websocket-javax-server</artifactId>
  <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
The `javax.websocket-api` artifact and the `websocket-javax-server` artifact (and its transitive dependencies) should be present in the server class-path (or module-path), and never in the web application's `/WEB-INF/lib` directory.
====

To configure correctly your WebSocket application based on the standard `javax.websocket` APIs, you need two steps:

. Make sure that Jetty xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-container[sets up] an instance of `javax.websocket.server.ServerContainer`.
. xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-endpoints[Configure] the WebSocket endpoints that implement your application logic, either by annotating their classes with the standard `javax.websocket` annotations, or by using the `ServerContainer` APIs to register them in your code.

[[pg-server-websocket-standard-container]]
===== Setting Up `ServerContainer`

Jetty sets up a `ServerContainer` instance using `JavaxWebSocketServletContainerInitializer`.

When you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context[`WebAppContext`], then  `JavaxWebSocketServletContainerInitializer` is automatically discovered and initialized by Jetty when the web application starts, so that it sets up the `ServerContainer`.
In this way, you do not need to write any additional code:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=standardContainerWebAppContext]
----

On the other hand, when you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context[`ServletContextHandler`], you have to write the code to ensure that the `JavaxWebSocketServletContainerInitializer` is initialized, so that it sets up the `ServerContainer`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=standardContainerServletContextHandler]
----

Calling `JavaxWebSocketServletContainerInitializer.configure(\...)` must be done _before_ the `ServletContextHandler` is started, and configures the `javax.websocket` implementation for that web application context.

[[pg-server-websocket-standard-endpoints]]
===== Configuring Endpoints

Once you have xref:pg-server-websocket-standard-container[setup] the `ServerContainer`, you can configure your WebSocket endpoints.

The WebSocket endpoints classes may be either annotated with the standard `javax.websocket` annotations, extend the `javax.websocket.Endpoint` abstract class, or implement the `javax.websocket.server.ServerApplicationConfig` interface.

When you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context[`WebAppContext`], then annotated WebSocket endpoint classes are automatically discovered and registered.
In this way, you do not need to write any additional code; you just need to ensure that your WebSocket endpoint classes are present in the web application's `/WEB-INF/classes` directory, or in a `*.jar` file in `/WEB-INF/lib`.

On the other hand, when you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-webapp-context[`WebAppContext`] but you need to perform more advanced configuration of the `ServerContainer` or of the WebSocket endpoints, or when you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context[`ServletContextHandler`], you need to access the `ServerContainer` APIs.

The `ServerContainer` instance is stored as a `ServletContext` attribute, so it can be retrieved when the `ServletContext` is initialized, either from a `ServletContextListener` or from a `HttpServlet`:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=standardEndpointsInitialization]
----

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=standardWebSocketInitializerServlet]
----

When you deploy web applications using xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-servlet-context[`ServletContextHandler`], you can also use this variant to set up the `ServerContainer` and configure the WebSocket endpoints in one step:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../{doc_code}/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/server/websocket/WebSocketServerDocs.java[tags=standardContainerAndEndpoints]
----

When the `ServletContextHandler` is started, the `Configurator` lambda (the second parameter passed to `JavaxWebSocketServletContainerInitializer.configure(\...)`) is invoked and allows you to explicitly configure the WebSocket endpoints using the standard APIs provided by `ServerContainer`.

[[pg-server-websocket-standard-upgrade]]
====== Upgrade to WebSocket

Under the hood, `JavaxWebSocketServletContainerInitializer` installs the `org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.servlet.WebSocketUpgradeFilter`, which is the component that intercepts HTTP requests to upgrade to WebSocket, and performs the upgrade from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

[NOTE]
====
The `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` is installed under the filter name corresponding to its class name (that is, the string `"org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.servlet.WebSocketUpgradeFilter"`) and with a filter mapping of `/*`.

Refer to the xref:pg-server-websocket-configure-filter[advanced `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` configuration section] for more information.
====

With the default configuration, every HTTP request flows first through the `WebSocketUpgradeFilter`.

If the HTTP request is a valid upgrade to WebSocket, then `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` tries to find a matching WebSocket endpoint for the request URI path; if the match is found, `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` performs the upgrade and does not invoke any other Filter or Servlet.
From this point on, the communication happens with the WebSocket protocol, and HTTP components such as Filters and Servlets are not relevant anymore.

If the HTTP request is not an upgrade to WebSocket, or `WebSocketUpgradeFilter` did not find a matching WebSocket endpoint for the request URI path, then the request is passed to the Filter chain of your web application, and eventually the request arrives to a Servlet to be processed (otherwise a `404 Not Found` response is returned to client).
