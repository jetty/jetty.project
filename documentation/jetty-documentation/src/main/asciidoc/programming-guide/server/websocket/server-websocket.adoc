[[pg-server-websocket]]
=== WebSocket Server

Jetty provides two API implementations of the WebSocket protocol:

* An implementation for the standard `javax.websocket` APIs provided by link:https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356[JSR 356], described in xref:pg-server-websocket-standard[this section].
* An implementation for Jetty-specific WebSocket APIs, described in xref:pg-server-websocket-jetty[this section].

Using the standard `javax.websocket` APIs allows your applications to depend only on standard APIs, and your applications may be deployed in any compliant WebSocket Container that supports JSR 356.

The standard APIs provide few features that are not present in the Jetty WebSocket APIs:

* Encoders and Decoders for automatic conversion of text or binary messages to objects.
* `Reader` and `InputStream` for simple, blocking, message streaming.
* Simple URI template matching.

On the other hand, the Jetty WebSocket APIs are more efficient and offer greater and more fine-grained control, and provide features that are not present in the standard APIs:

* Suspend/resume to control backpressure.
* Remote socket address (IP address and port) information.
* WebSocket upgrade handling via Filter or Servlet.
* Advanced URI matching with Servlet WebSocket upgrade.
* Control of the idle timeout.
* Configuration of the network buffer capacity.

If your application needs specific features that are not provided by the standard APIs, the Jetty WebSocket APIs may provide such features -- and if they do not, you may ask for these features by submitting an issue to the Jetty Project without waiting for the standard process to approve them.
