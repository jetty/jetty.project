=== Logging

The Jetty libraries (both client and server) use link:http://slf4j.org/[SLF4J] as logging APIs.
You can therefore plug in any SLF4J logging implementation, and configure the logging category `org.eclipse.jetty` at the desired level.

When you have problems with Jetty, the first thing that you want to do is to enable DEBUG logging.
This is helpful because by reading the DEBUG logs you get a better understanding of what is going on in the system (and that alone may give you the answers you need to fix the problem), and because Jetty developers will probably need the DEBUG logs to help you.

==== Jetty SLF4J Binding

The Jetty artifact `jetty-slf4j-impl` is a SLF4J binding, that is the Jetty implementation of the SLF4J APIs, and provides a number of easy-to-use features to configure logging.

The Jetty SLF4J binding only provides an appender that writes to `System.err`.
For more advanced configurations (for example, logging to a file), use link:http://logback.qos.ch[LogBack], or link:https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[Log4j2], or your preferred SLF4J binding.

CAUTION: Only one binding can be present in the class-path or module-path. If you use the LogBack SLF4J binding or the Log4j2 SLF4J binding, remember to remove the Jetty SLF4J binding.

The Jetty SLF4J binding reads a file in the class-path (or module-path) called `jetty-logging.properties` that can be configured with the logging levels for various logger categories:

.jetty-logging.properties
[source,screen]
----
# By default, log at INFO level all Jetty classes.
org.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=INFO

# However, the Jetty client classes are logged at DEBUG level.
org.eclipse.jetty.client.LEVEL=DEBUG
----

Similarly to how you configure the `jetty-logging.properties` file, you can set the system property `org.eclipse.jetty[.<package_names>].LEVEL=DEBUG` to quickly change the logging level to DEBUG without editing any file.
The system property can be set on the command line, or in your IDE when you run your tests or your Jetty-based application and will override the `jetty-logging.properties` file configuration.
For example to enable DEBUG logging for all the Jetty classes (_very_ verbose):

[source,screen]
----
java -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=DEBUG --class-path ...
----

If you want to enable DEBUG logging but only for the HTTP/2 classes:

[source,screen]
----
java -Dorg.eclipse.jetty.http2.LEVEL=DEBUG --class-path ...
----

[[pg-troubleshooting-state-tracking]]
=== `StateTrackingHandler`

`StateTrackingHandler` (described xref:pg-server-http-handler-use-state-tracking[here]) is a troubleshooting `Handler` that can be inserted in the `Handler` chain to track usages of `Handler`/`Request`/`Response` asynchronous APIs.

xref:pg-troubleshooting-component-dump[Dumping the Jetty component tree] will dump the `StateTrackingHandler`, which will dump the state of the current requests.

This will help detecting whether requests are not completed due to callbacks not being completed, or whether callback code is stuck while invoking blocking APIs, etc.

Thread stack traces (including virtual threads) of operations that have been started but not completed, or are stuck in blocking code are provided in the component tree dump.

[[pg-troubleshooting-component-dump]]
=== Component Tree Dump

Jetty components are organized in a xref:pg-arch-bean[component tree].

At the root of the component tree there is typically a `ContainerLifeCycle` instance -- typically a `Server` instance on the server and an `HttpClient` instance on the client.

`ContainerLifeCycle` has built-in _dump_ APIs that can be invoked either directly on the `Server` instance, or xref:pg-arch-jmx[via JMX].

You can invoke `Server.dump()` via JMX using a JMX console such as link:https://adoptium.net/jmc.html[Java Mission Control (JMC)]:

TIP: You can get more details from a Jetty's `QueuedThreadPool` dump by enabling detailed dumps via `queuedThreadPool.setDetailedDump(true)`.

[[pg-troubleshooting-debugging]]
=== Remote Debugging

Sometimes, in order to figure out a problem, enabling xref:pg-troubleshooting-logging[DEBUG logging] is not enough and you really need to debug the code with a debugger.

Debugging an embedded Jetty application is most easily done from your preferred IDE, so refer to your IDE instruction for how to debug Java applications.

Remote debugging can be enabled in a Jetty application via command line options:

[source,screen]
----
java -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8000 --class-path ...
----

The example above enables remote debugging so that debuggers (for example, your preferred IDE) can connect to port `8000` on the host running the Jetty application to receive debugging events.

NOTE: More technically, remote debugging exchanges JVM Tools Interface (JVMTI) events and commands via the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP).
