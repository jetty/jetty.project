= Architecture Overview

Jetty is an HTTP server and Servlet Container, and supports deployments of web applications.

The xref:server/index.adoc[Jetty server] listens on one or more network ports using one or more xref:protocols/index.adoc[protocol connectors].

Clients send HTTP requests for specific URIs, such as `+https://host/store/cart+`.

The HTTP requests arrive to the connectors through the network; the Jetty server processes the requests and, based on their URIs, forwards them to the appropriate xref:deploy/index.adoc[deployed web application].

[[concepts]]
== Main Concepts
There are three main concepts on which the Jetty standalone server is based:

* The <<modules,Jetty _module_ system>>, where Jetty modules provides Jetty features.
* The <<jetty-base,`$JETTY_BASE` directory>>, that provides a place where you configure which Jetty modules you want to enable, configure the properties of each enabled module, and therefore configure the features you need for your web applications.
* The <<start,Jetty start mechanism>>, that starts a JVM that runs Jetty with the configuration you specified.

After installing Jetty, you will want to set up a <<jetty-base,`$JETTY_BASE` directory>> where you configure <<modules,Jetty modules>>.

[[modules]]
== Jetty Modules

The Jetty standalone server is made of Java components that are assembled together, configured and started to provide different features.

A Jetty _module_ provides one or more components that work together to provide typically one feature, although they may provide more than one feature.

A Jetty module is nothing more than Jetty components assembled together like you would do using Java APIs, just done in a declarative way using configuration files.
What you can do in Java code to assemble Jetty components can be done using Jetty modules.

A Jetty module may be dependent on other Jetty modules: for example, the `http` Jetty module depends on the `server` Jetty module which in turn depends on the `threadpool` and `logging` Jetty modules.

Every feature in a Jetty server is enabled by enabling the corresponding Jetty module(s).

For example, if you enable only the `http` Jetty module, then your Jetty standalone server will only be able to listen to a network port for clear-text HTTP requests.
It will not be able to process secure HTTP (i.e. `https`) requests, it will not be able to process WebSocket, or HTTP/2, or HTTP/3 or any other protocol because the correspondent modules have not been enabled.

You can even start a Jetty server _without_ listening on a network port -- for example because you have enabled a custom module you wrote that provides the features you need.

This allows the Jetty standalone server to be as small as necessary: modules that are not enabled are not loaded, don't waste memory, and you don't risk a client using a module that you did not know was even there.

For more detailed information about the Jetty module system, see xref:modules/index.adoc[this section].

[[jetty-base]]
== `$JETTY_HOME` and `$JETTY_BASE`

Instead of managing multiple Jetty distributions out of many locations, it is possible to maintain a separation between the binary installation of the standalone Jetty, known as `$JETTY_HOME`, and the customizations for your specific environment(s), known as `$JETTY_BASE`.

This separation between the binary installation directory and the specific configuration directory allows managing multiple, different, server configurations, and allows for quick, drop-in upgrades of Jetty.

There should always only be *one* `$JETTY_HOME` (per version of Jetty), but there can be many `$JETTY_BASE` directories that reference it.

This separation between `$JETTY_HOME` and `$JETTY_BASE` allows Jetty upgrades without affecting your web applications.
`$JETTY_HOME` contains the Jetty runtime and libraries and the default configuration, while a `$JETTY_BASE` contains your web applications and any override of the default configuration.

For example, with the `$JETTY_HOME` installation the default value for the network port for clear-text HTTP is `8080`.
However, you may want that port to be `6060`, because xref:protocols/index.adoc#proxy[Jetty is behind a load balancer] that is configured to forward to the backend on port `6060`.
In this case, you configure the clear-text HTTP port in `$JETTY_BASE`, not in `$JETTY_HOME`.
When you upgrade Jetty, you will upgrade only the files in `$JETTY_HOME`, and all the configuration in `$JETTY_BASE` will remain unchanged, keeping your clear-text HTTP port at `6060`.

Installing the Jetty runtime and libraries in `$JETTY_HOME` also allows you to leverage file system permissions: `$JETTY_HOME` may be owned by an administrator user (so that only administrators can upgrade it), while `$JETTY_BASE` directories may be owned by a less privileged user.

If you had changed the default configuration in `$JETTY_HOME`, when you upgrade Jetty, say from version `10.0.0` to version `10.0.1`, your changes would be lost.
Maintaining all the changes in `$JETTY_HOME`, and having to reconfigure these with each upgrade results in a massive commitment of time and effort.

To recap:

`$JETTY_HOME`::
This is the location for the Jetty binaries.
`$JETTY_BASE`::
This is the location for your configurations and customizations to the Jetty binaries.

[[start]]
== Start Mechanism

The Jetty start mechanism provides two features:

* The mean to configure your `$JETTY_BASE` by enabling the desired modules, and to display the configuration of your `$JETTY_BASE`.
* The mean to start Jetty itself, by starting a JVM that reads the Jetty configuration in `$JETTY_BASE`, which is then executed to assemble and start the Jetty components.

The Jetty start mechanism is invoked by executing `$JETTY_HOME/start.jar` from within your `$JETTY_BASE`, and you can think of it as the Jetty command line program, similar to many Unix/Windows command line programs.

For example, you can ask for help:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --help
----

Or you can list all available modules (or only those with a specific tag):

----
# List all the modules.
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --list-modules=*

# List all the modules tagged as "demo".
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --list-modules=demo
----

You can enable a module, for example the `http` module:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=http
----

Once you have one or more module enabled, you can display the current configuration, to verify that the configuration is correct:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --list-config
----

You can enable a Jetty demo module, which will deploy a demo web application:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=demo-simple
----

Finally, you can start Jetty:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar
----
