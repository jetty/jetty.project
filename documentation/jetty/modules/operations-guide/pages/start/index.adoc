= Jetty Start Mechanism

NOTE: Make sure you have read the xref:arch/index.adoc[Jetty architecture section] if you are not familiar with the terms used in this section.

The Jetty start mechanism is invoked by executing `$JETTY_HOME/start.jar`, from within a `$JETTY_BASE` directory, with zero or more command line options:

----
$ cd $JETTY_BASE
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar ...
----

The Jetty start mechanism has two main modes of operation:

* The _tool_ mode, detailed in <<configure,this section>>, when it is used as a command line tool to configure the `$JETTY_BASE` directory by enabling modules, creating sub-directories and files, downloading files, etc.
In this mode, the JVM started with `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar` performs the specified command and then exits.
* The _start_ mode, detailed in <<start,this section>>, when it is used to start the JVM that runs Jetty with the specified configuration.
In this mode, the JVM started with `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar` starts Jetty and does not exit until stopped, for example by hitting kbd:[Ctrl+C] on the terminal.

Refer to the <<reference,Jetty start mechanism reference section>> for the complete list of the available command line options.

You want to use the Jetty start mechanism to <<configure,configure your $JETTY_BASE>> and then to <<start,start Jetty>>.

[[configure]]
== Configuring $JETTY_BASE

Within the Jetty start mechanism, the source of configurations is layered in this order, from higher priority to lower priority:

* The command line options.
* The `$JETTY_BASE` directory, and its files.
* The directory specified with the `--add-config-dir` option, and its files.
* The `$JETTY_HOME` directory, and its files.

[[configure-enable]]
=== Enabling Modules

You can enable Jetty modules persistently across restarts with the `--add-modules` command:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=server,http
----

The Jetty start mechanism will look for the specified modules following the order specified above.
In the common case (without a `--add-config-dir` directory), it will look in `$JETTY_BASE/modules/` first and then in `$JETTY_HOME/modules/`.

Since the `server` and `http` modules are standard Jetty modules, they are present in `$JETTY_HOME/modules/` and loaded from there.

When you enable a Jetty module, the Jetty start mechanism:

* Creates the correspondent `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` module configuration file.
The content of these `+*.ini+` files is copied from the `[ini-template]` section of the correspondent `+*.mod+` file.
* Executes the directives specified in `[files]` section (if present) of the `+*.mod+` file.
This may simply create a file or a directory, or download files from the Internet.
This step is performed transitively for all module dependencies.

For example, enabling the `server` and `http` modules results in the `$JETTY_BASE` directory to have the following structure:

----
$JETTY_BASE
├── resources
│   └── jetty-logging.properties
└── start.d
    ├── http.ini
    └── server.ini
----

The `$JETTY_BASE/resources/jetty-logging.properties` is created by the `[files]` directives of the `logging-jetty` module, which is a transitive dependency of the `server` module.

[[configure-disable]]
=== Disabling Modules

A module is enabled because the correspondent `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` file contains a `--module=<name>` directive.

Commenting out the `--module=<name>` directive effectively disables the module.

Deleting the correspondent `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` file also disables the module.

[[configure-edit-ini]]
=== Editing `+*.ini+` Files

You can now edit the `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` configuration files, typically by uncommenting properties to change their default value.

The `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` configuration file may be missing, if the correspondent module is a transitive dependency.
You can easily generate the configuration file by explicitly enabling the module, for example to generate the `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/logging-jetty.ini` configuration file you would issue the following command (the module order does not matter):

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=server,http,logging-jetty
----

The `$JETTY_BASE` directory structure is now:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$JETTY_BASE
├── resources
│   └── jetty-logging.properties
└── start.d
    ├── http.ini
    ├── ##logging-jetty.ini##
    └── server.ini
----

You want to edit the `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` configuration files so that the configuration is applied every time Jetty is started (or re-started).

For example, `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/http.ini` contains the following property, commented out:

.http.ini
----
# jetty.http.port=8080
----

You can change the clear-text HTTP port Jetty listens to by uncommenting that property and changing its value:

.http.ini
----
jetty.http.port=9876
----

When Jetty is started (or re-started) this configuration is applied and Jetty will listen for clear-text HTTP/1.1 on port `9876`.

[[configure-enable-command-line]]
=== Enabling Modules on Command Line

You can also enable a module transiently, only for the current execution of the `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar` command.

If you have an empty `$JETTY_BASE`, the following command enables the `server` and `http` modules, but does not create any `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` files.

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --module=server,http
----

Since there are no `+$JETTY_BASE/start.d/*.ini+` files, you can only customize the properties via the command line, for example:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --module=server,http jetty.http.port=9876
----

Enabling modules on the command line is useful to verify that the modules work as expected, or to try different configurations.

NOTE: It is possible to enable some module persistently via `--add-modules` and some other module transiently via `--module`.

Remember that once the current execution terminates, the modules enabled transiently on the command line via `--module` and their configuration are not saved and will not be enabled on the next execution (unless you specify them again on the command line).

[[configure-custom-module]]
=== Adding Your Own Modules

NOTE: Refer to the xref:modules/custom.adoc[custom module section] for the details about how to create your own modules.

You can add your own modules by adding a `+$JETTY_BASE/modules/*.mod+` file.

For example, you may want to add a Postgres JDBC driver to the server class-path, to avoid that each deployed web application bring its own version. This allows you to control the exact Postgres JDBC driver version for all web applications.

Create the `$JETTY_BASE/modules/postgresql.mod` file:

.postgresql.mod
----
include::code:example$jetty-modules/postgresql.mod[]
----

Then enable it:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=postgresql
----

Enabling the `postgresql` module will execute the `[files]` directive (downloading the `+*.jar+` file from Maven Central if not already present) and create the `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/postgresql.ini` with the content of the `[ini-template]` section.

The `[lib]` section ensures that the specified file is in the server class-path when Jetty is started.

You can <<configure-display,display the Jetty configuration>> to verify that the server class-path is correct.

[[configure-custom-module-exec]]
=== Custom Module with JVM Options

Using a custom Jetty module, you can customize the JVM startup options.

This is useful if you need to start Jetty and want to specify JVM options such as:

* `+-Xmx+`, to specify the max heap size
* `+-Xlog:gc+`, to specify the GC log file and options
* `+-javaagent+`, to specify Java agents
* `+-XX:+` options, for example to specify the GC implementation
* `+--enable-preview+`, to enable Java preview features

Start by creating `$JETTY_BASE/modules/jvm.mod`:

.jvm.mod
----
include::code:example$jetty-modules/jvm.mod[]
----

Enable it:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=jvm
----

Since the module defines an `[exec]` section, it will fork _another_ JVM when Jetty is started.

This means that when you start Jetty, there will be _two_ JVMs running: one created by you when you run `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar`, and another forked by the Jetty start mechanism with the JVM options you specified (that cannot be applied to an already running JVM).

Again, you can <<configure-dry-run,display the JVM command line>> to verify that it is correct.

[TIP]
====
The second JVM forked by the Jetty start mechanism when one of the modules requires forking, for example a module that contains an `[exec]` section, may not be desirable, and may be avoided as explained in <<configure-dry-run,this section>>.
====

[[configure-display]]
=== Displaying the Configuration

Once you have enabled and configured the `$JETTY_BASE`, you can display the configuration to verify that it is correct.

Using the standard `server` and `http` Jetty modules, and the `postgresql` and `jvm` custom Jetty module defined above, you obtain:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --list-config
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupModules=code:example$jetty-modules/jvm.mod,code:example$jetty-modules/postgresql.mod
setupArgs=--add-modules=server,http,postgresql,jvm
args=--list-config
....

Note how the configuration displayed above includes:

* In the list of enabled modules, the `postgresql` and `jvm` modules
* In the list of JVM arguments, those specified by the `jvm` module
* In the server class-path, the `+*.jar+` file specified by the `postgresql` module

[[configure-dry-run]]
=== Displaying the JVM Command Line

The Jetty start mechanism can display a full JVM command line that will start Jetty with the configuration you specified, with the `--dry-run` option:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run
----

The full JVM command line generated by `--dry-run` can be split in various parts that can be used individually, for example in scripts.

Furthermore, Jetty modules may specify the `--exec` option that will fork a second JVM to start Jetty, which may not be desirable.
Some option, such as `--jpms`, imply `--exec`, as it won't be possible to modify the module-path in the already started JVM.

To start Jetty without forking a second JVM, the `--dry-run` option can be used to generate a command line that is then executed so that starting Jetty only spawns one JVM.

IMPORTANT: You can use the `--dry-run` option as explained below to avoid forking a second JVM when using modules that have the `[exec]` section, or the `--exec` option, or when using the `--jpms` option.

For example, using the `--dry-run` option with the `jvm.mod` introduced in <<configure-custom-module-exec,this section>> produces the following command line:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupModules=code:example$jetty-modules/jvm.mod
setupArgs=--add-modules=http,jvm
args=--dry-run
replace=( ),$1\\\n
....

You can then run the generated command line.

For example, in the Linux `bash` shell you can run it by wrapping it into `$(\...)`:

----
$ $(java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run)
----

The `--dry-run` option is quite flexible and below you can find a few examples of how to use it to avoid forking a second JVM, or generating scripts or creating an arguments file that can be passed to (a possibly alternative) `java` executable.

To display the `java` executable used to start Jetty:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=##java##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupArgs=--add-modules=http
args=--dry-run=java
....

To display the JVM options:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=##opts##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupModules=code:example$jetty-modules/jvm.mod
setupArgs=--add-modules=http,jvm
args=--dry-run=opts
replace=( ),$1\\\n
....

To display the JVM class-path:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=##path##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupModules=code:example$jetty-modules/postgresql.mod
setupArgs=--add-modules=http,jvm
args=--dry-run=path
replace=( |:),$1\\\n
....

To display the JVM class-path and module-path, if you want to xref:start/start-jpms.adoc[start Jetty using JPMS] with the `--jpms` option:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar ##--jpms## --dry-run=##path##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupModules=code:example$jetty-modules/postgresql.mod
setupArgs=--add-modules=http,jvm
args=--jpms --dry-run=path
replace=( |:),$1\\\n
....

To display the JVM main class:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=##main##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupArgs=--add-modules=http
args=--dry-run=main
....

To display the JVM main class when xref:start/start-jpms.adoc[starting Jetty using JPMS]:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --jpms --dry-run=##main##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupArgs=--add-modules=http
args=--jpms --dry-run=main
....

The main class is typically Jetty's `XmlConfiguration` class that accepts, as program arguments, a list of properties and a list of Jetty XML files to process.
The Jetty XML files compose together the Jetty components that are then configured with the values from the command line properties.

To display the program arguments passed to the main class:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=##args##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupModules=code:example$jetty-modules/postgresql.mod
setupArgs=--add-modules=http
args=--dry-run=args
replace=( ),$1\\\n
....

Note how the program arguments are a list of properties in the form `<name>=<value>` and a list of Jetty XML files.

The various parts of the full JVM command line can be combined to leverage the arguments file feature (that is, specify the JVM options in a file rather than on the command line) that is built-in in the `java` executable:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=##opts,path,main,args## > /tmp/jvm_cmd_line.txt
$ /some/other/java @/tmp/jvm_cmd_line.txt
----

Using `--dry-run=opts,path,main,args` can be used to avoid that the Jetty start mechanism forks a second JVM when using modules that require forking:

----
$ java $(java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --dry-run=opts,path,main,args)
----

The output of different `--dry-run` executions can be creatively combined in a shell script:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ OPTS=$(java -jar start.jar --dry-run=##opts,path##)
$ MAIN=$(java -jar start.jar --dry-run=##main##)
$ ARGS=$(java -jar start.jar --dry-run=##args##)
$ java $OPTS -Dextra=opt $MAIN $ARGS extraProp=value extra.xml
----

[[start]]
== Starting Jetty

After you have configured the `$JETTY_BASE` directory, as explained in <<configure,this section>>, you can start Jetty as a standalone server.

In the _start_ mode, the Jetty start mechanism computes a JVM command line with JVM options, system properties, class-path, module-path, main class and program arguments, and then executes it, forking a new JVM if necessary.

The Jetty start mechanism performs these steps:

. Loads all the Jetty modules files (that have extension `+*.mod+`) from the `modules/` subdirectory of each configuration source directory (see <<configure,this section>> for the list of configuration sources).
In this way, a Jetty module graph can be built in memory, where the module dependencies form the edges of the graph and each node contains the metadata information declared by each module (for example, the libraries that it needs, the XML files to process, and so on), in preparation for the next step.
. Reads the Jetty module configuration files (that have extension `+*.ini+`) from the `start.d/` subdirectory of each configuration source directory and from the command line.
This step produces a list of _enabled_ modules; for each enabled module all its dependencies are transitively resolved by navigating the graph built in the previous steps.
. Processes the list of enabled (explicitly and transitively) modules, gathering the list of libraries to add to the class-path, the JPMS directives to add to the command line, the properties and XML files to add as program arguments, etc., so that a full JVM command line can be generated.
. Executes the command line, either in-JVM or by forking a second JVM (if the `--exec` option is present or implied by other options such as `--jpms`), and waits for the JVM, or the forked JVM, to exit.

[[start-class-path]]
=== Server Class-Path

When the Jetty server is started in-JVM, the server class-path gathered by processing the enabled modules is organized in a `URLClassLoader`, the Jetty Start ClassLoader, that is a child of the System ClassLoader:

[plantuml]
----
skinparam backgroundColor transparent
skinparam monochrome true
skinparam shadowing false
skinparam roundCorner 10

rectangle "Jetty Start JVM" {
  rectangle "System ClassLoader" as system
  rectangle "Jetty Start ClassLoader" as start

  note right of system: start.jar
  note right of start: jetty-server.jar\njetty-http.jar\njetty-io.jar\njetty-util.jar\njetty-xml.jar\netc.

  system <-- start
}
----

The System ClassLoader only has `$JETTY_HOME/start.jar` in its class-path, since the JVM was started with `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar`.
The Jetty Start ClassLoader has in its class-path the `+*.jar+` files gathered by processing the enabled modules, typically from `+$JETTY_HOME/lib/jetty-*.jar+`, but possibly also from `+$JETTY_BASE/lib/*.jar+` if custom modules extend the server class-path with their own `+*.jar+` files.

When the Jetty server is started in a forked JVM, there will be two JVMs: one started by you with `java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar` and one forked by the Jetty start mechanism.
In the forked JVM, the System ClassLoader has the server class-path and/or module-path in its class-path, since the forked JVM is started with `+java --class-path $JETTY_HOME/lib/jetty-server-<version>.jar:...+`:

  note right of system2: jetty-server.jar\njetty-http.jar\njetty-io.jar\njetty-util.jar\njetty-xml.jar\netc.
}

startJVM --> forkedJVM: " waits for"
----

It is worth mentioning that there are two standard Jetty modules that allow you to easily add entries to the Jetty server class-path:

* The xref:modules/standard.adoc#resources[`resources` module], which adds the `$JETTY_BASE/resources` directory to the server class-path.
This is useful if you have third party libraries that lookup resources from the class-path: just put those resources in the `$JETTY_BASE/resources/` directory. +
Logging libraries often perform class-path lookup of their configuration files (for example, `log4j.properties`, `log4j.xml`, `logging.properties`, and `logback.xml`), so `$JETTY_BASE/resources/` is the ideal place to add those files. +
* The the `ext` module, that adds all the `+*.jar+` files under the `$JETTY_BASE/lib/ext/` directory, and subdirectories recursively, to the server class-path. +
+
[CAUTION]
====
On one hand, the `ext` module provides a handy place to put third party libraries and their dependencies; on the other hand, the `$JETTY_BASE/lib/ext/` directory may become a confused mixture of many `+*.jar+` files from different third party libraries.

Prefer to group third party libraries and their dependencies into their own directories using xref:modules/custom.adoc[custom modules], or at least group them into `$JETTY_BASE/lib/ext/` subdirectories such as `$JETTY_BASE/lib/ext/util/` or `$JETTY_BASE/lib/ext/acme/`.
====

[[start-xml]]
=== Assembling Jetty Components

The Jetty start mechanism eventually invokes, by default, main class `org.eclipse.jetty.xml.XmlConfiguration`, passing properties and xref:xml/index.adoc[Jetty XML files] as program arguments.

The Jetty XML files are nothing more than Java code in XML format.

The XML files are processed to instantiate Jetty components such as `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server` or `org.eclipse.jetty.util.ssl.SslContextFactory$Server`.
The components are then assembled together to provide the configured Jetty features.

The Jetty XML files are parametrized using properties, and a property is just a name/value pair.

This parametrization of the XML files allows an XML file that resides in `$JETTY_HOME/etc/` to _declare_ a property such as `jetty.http.port`, and allow this property to be set in a `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/http.ini` file, so that you don't need to change the XML files in `$JETTY_HOME`, but only change files in your `$JETTY_BASE`.

You can write your own xref:modules/custom.adoc[custom modules] with your own Jetty XML files, and your own properties, to further customize Jetty.

[[stop]]
== Stopping Jetty

When Jetty is started, the Jetty components that you have configured by enabling Jetty modules are assembled and started.

If you have started Jetty from a terminal, you can exit the Jetty JVM by hitting kbd:[Ctrl+C] on the same terminal.

Similarly, from a different terminal, you can exit the Jetty JVM using `kill -INT <pid>` or `kill -TERM <pid>`.

In the three cases above, the JVM is exited, but by default Jetty components are not stopped.
If you want to stop the Jetty components, to stop Jetty more gracefully, you can start Jetty with this property:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar ##jetty.server.stopAtShutdown=true##
----

This property can also be set in `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/server.ini` so that it is persistently configured across Jetty restarts (see also xref:modules/standard.adoc#server[the `server` module]).

The `jetty.server.stopAtShutdown` property configures a JVM shutdown hook that is run, stopping the `Server` instance, when the JVM exits.

Obviously, the JVM can also be stopped with `kill -KILL <pid>` that exits the process abruptly without running the JVM shutdown hooks.

[[stop-remote]]
=== Stopping Jetty from Remote

You can configure a Jetty server so that it can be stopped by remote clients using a command sent through a TCP socket.

You can start Jetty with the following properties:

* `stop.host`, the host name Jetty will bind to listen for stop commands. Defaults to `127.0.0.1` which means that the stop command can be issued only clients that run on the same host as Jetty.
* `stop.port`, the port number Jetty will listen to for stop commands. Defaults to `-1`, which means that Jetty will not listen to any port.
* `stop.key`, the password to verify when a stop command is received. Defaults to a password that is randomly generated and printed when Jetty starts.

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar ##stop.port=8181##
----

[jetty%nowrap]
....
[jetty]
setupArgs=--add-modules=http
args=stop.port=8181
highlight=(?i)stop.key
....

In the example above, Jetty is started with just the `stop.port` property, and the `stop.key` is printed on the terminal when Jetty starts.

CAUTION: You can choose your own `stop.key`, but make sure it's a strong password.

A remote client can now use the Jetty start mechanism to stop the remote Jetty server:

[source,subs=+quotes]
----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar ##--stop## stop.port=8181 stop.key=<stop.key>
----

Note the `--stop` command along with the `stop.port` and `stop.key` properties.
The `stop.key` must be the same as the one of remote Jetty server, either the one you chose, or the one printed on the terminal when Jetty starts.

Remote clients can wait for the remote Jetty server to shut down by specifying the `stop.wait` property with the number of seconds to wait:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --stop stop.port=8181 stop.key=<stop.key> stop.wait=15
----

If the time specified elapses, without the confirmation that the remote Jetty server stopped, then the `--stop` command exits with a non-zero return code.

== Start Mechanism Logging

The steps performed by the Jetty start mechanism are logged by the `StartLog` class, that outputs directly, by default, to `System.err`.

This is necessary to avoid that the Jetty start mechanism depend on logging libraries that may clash with those defined by Jetty logging modules, when Jetty is started in-VM.

[NOTE]
====
This section is about the logging performed by the Jetty start mechanism _before_ it configures and starts Jetty.
See the xref:server/index.adoc#logging[logging section] for information about logging when Jetty starts.
====

You can enable DEBUG level logging with the `--debug` command line option, for both the _tool_ and _start_ modes:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --debug ...
----

You can send the start log output to a file, by default relative to `$JETTY_BASE`, with the `--start-log-file=<file>` option:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --debug --start-log-file=start.log ...
----

This is useful for capturing startup issues where the Jetty-specific logger has not yet kicked in due to a possible startup configuration error.
