= Starting Jetty using JPMS

Jetty modules are proper https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System[JPMS] modules: each Jetty module has a `module-info.class` file.
This makes possible to run Jetty from the module-path, rather than the class-path.

To start Jetty on the module-path rather than the class-path, it is enough to add the `--jpms` option to the command line, for example:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --jpms
----

[NOTE]
====
The `--jpms` option implies the `--exec` option.

When running on the module-path using the `--jpms` option, the Jetty start mechanism will fork a second JVM passing it the right JVM options to run on the module-path.

Therefore, you will have two JVMs running: one that runs `start.jar` and one that runs Jetty on the module-path.
====

When Jetty is started in JPMS mode, all JPMS modules in the module-path are added to the set of JPMS _root modules_ through the JVM option `--add-modules ALL_MODULE_PATH`.

For a `+*.jar+` file that is not a JPMS module, but is on the module-path, the JVM will assume internally it is an automatic JPMS module, with a JPMS module name derived from the `+*.jar+` file name.

Rather than adding the `--jpms` option to the command line, you can use a custom Jetty module to centralize your JPMS configuration, where you can specify additional JPMS directives.

Create the `$JETTY_BASE/modules/jpms.mod` file:

.jpms.mod
----
include::code:example$jetty-modules/jpms.mod[]
----

The `[ini]` section with `--jpms` is equivalent to passing the `--jpms` option to the command line (see also xref:modules/index.adoc#directive-ini[this section]).

The `[jpms]` section allows you to specify additional JPMS configuration, for example additional `--add-modules` options, or `--add-opens` options, etc. (see also xref:modules/index.adoc#directive-jpms[this section]).

Then enable it:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-modules=jpms
----

Now you can start Jetty without extra command line options, and it will start in JPMS mode because you have enabled the `jpms` module.

== Advanced JPMS Configuration

Web applications may need additional services from the Servlet Container, such as JDBC `DataSource` references or JTA `UserTransaction` references.

For example, for JDBC it is typical to store, in JNDI, a reference to the connection pool's `DataSource` or directly a reference to the JDBC driver's `DataSource` (for example, `org.postgresql.ds.PGConnectionPoolDataSource`).
Jetty needs to be able to instantiate those classes and therefore needs to be able to load those classes and all their super-classes, among which includes `javax.sql.DataSource`.

When Jetty runs on the class-path, this is easily achieved by using a xref:modules/custom.adoc[custom module] as explained in xref:start/index.adoc#configure-custom-module[this section].

However, when running on the module-path, things are quite different.

When Jetty tries to load, for example, class `org.postgresql.ds.PGConnectionPoolDataSource`, it must be in a JPMS module that is resolved in the run-time module graph.
Furthermore, any dependency, for example classes from the `java.sql` JPMS module, must also be in a module present in the resolved module graph.

Thanks to the fact that when Jetty starts in JPMS mode the `--add-modules ALL_MODULE_PATH` option is added to the JVM command line, every `+*.jar+` file in the module-path is also present in the module graph.

There are now two cases for the `postgresql-<version>.jar` file: either it is a proper JPMS module, or it is an automatic JPMS module (either an explicit automatic JPMS module with the `Automatic-Module-Name` attribute in the manifest, or an implicit automatic JPMS module whose name is derived from the `+*.jar+` file name).

If the `postgresql-<version>.jar` file is a proper JPMS module, then there is nothing more that you should do: the `postgresql-<version>.jar` file is in the module-path, and all the modules in the module-path are in the module graph, and any dependency declared in the `module-info.class` will be added to the module graph.

Otherwise, `postgresql-<version>.jar` file is an automatic module, and will likely have a dependency on the JDK-bundled `java.sql` JPMS module.
However, the `java.sql` JPMS module is not in the module graph, because automatic modules do not have a way to declare their dependencies.

For this reason, you have to manually add the `java.sql` dependency to the module graph.
Using the `postgresql.mod` introduced in xref:start/index.adoc#configure-custom-module[this section] as an example, modify your custom module in the following way:

.postgresql.mod
----
...

[jpms]
add-modules: java.sql
----

The `[jpms]` section is only used when Jetty is started on the module-path.
