= Jetty I/O Architecture

The Jetty libraries (both client and server) use Java NIO to handle I/O, so that at its core Jetty I/O is completely non-blocking.

[[selector-manager]]
== Jetty I/O: `SelectorManager`

The main class of The Jetty I/O library is link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SelectorManager.html[`SelectorManager`].

`SelectorManager` manages internally a configurable number of link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/ManagedSelector.html[`ManagedSelector`]s.
Each `ManagedSelector` wraps an instance of `java.nio.channels.Selector` that in turn manages a number of `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel` instances.

NOTE: TODO: add image

`SocketChannel` instances are typically created by the Jetty implementation, on client-side when connecting to a server and on server-side when accepting connections from clients.
In both cases the `SocketChannel` instance is passed to `SelectorManager` (which passes it to `ManagedSelector` and eventually to `java.nio.channels.Selector`) to be registered for use within Jetty.

It is possible for an application to create the `SocketChannel` instances outside Jetty, even perform some initial network traffic also outside Jetty (for example for authentication purposes), and then pass the `SocketChannel` instance to `SelectorManager` for use within Jetty.

This example shows how a client can connect to a server:

[[endpoint-connection]]
== Jetty I/O: `EndPoint` and `Connection`

``SocketChannel``s that are passed to `SelectorManager` are wrapped into two related components: an link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/EndPoint.html[`EndPoint`] and a link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/Connection.html[`Connection`].

`EndPoint` is the Jetty abstraction for a `SocketChannel` or a `DatagramChannel`: you can read bytes from an `EndPoint`, you can write bytes to an `EndPoint` , you can close an `EndPoint`, etc.

`Connection` is the Jetty abstraction that is responsible to read bytes from the `EndPoint` and to deserialize the read bytes into objects.
For example, an HTTP/1.1 server-side `Connection` implementation is responsible to deserialize HTTP/1.1 request bytes into an HTTP request object.
Conversely, an HTTP/1.1 client-side `Connection` implementation is responsible to deserialize HTTP/1.1 response bytes into an HTTP response object.

`Connection` is the abstraction that implements the reading side of a specific protocol such as HTTP/1.1, or HTTP/2, or HTTP/3, or WebSocket: it is able to read and parse incoming bytes in that protocol.

The writing side for a specific protocol _may_ be implemented in the `Connection` but may also be implemented in other components, although eventually the bytes to write will be written through the `EndPoint`.

While there are primarily only two implementations of `EndPoint`,link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/SocketChannelEndPoint.html[`SocketChannelEndPoint`] for TCP and link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/DatagramChannelEndPoint.html[`DatagramChannelEndPoint`] for UDP (used both on the client-side and on the server-side), there are many implementations of `Connection`, typically two for each protocol (one for the client-side and one for the server-side).

The `EndPoint` and `Connection` pairs can be chained, for example in case of encrypted communication using the TLS protocol.
There is an `EndPoint` and `Connection` TLS pair where the `EndPoint` reads the encrypted bytes from the socket and the `Connection` decrypts them; next in the chain there is an `EndPoint` and `Connection` pair where the `EndPoint` "reads" decrypted bytes (provided by the previous `Connection`) and the `Connection` deserializes them into specific protocol objects (for example HTTP/2 frame objects).

Certain protocols, such as WebSocket, start the communication with the server using one protocol (for example, HTTP/1.1), but then change the communication to use another protocol (for example, WebSocket).
`EndPoint` supports changing the `Connection` object on-the-fly via `EndPoint.upgrade(Connection)`.
This allows to use the HTTP/1.1 `Connection` during the initial communication and later to replace it with a WebSocket `Connection`.

// TODO: add a section on `UpgradeFrom` and `UpgradeTo`?

`SelectorManager` is an abstract class because while it knows how to create concrete `EndPoint` instances, it does not know how to create protocol specific `Connection` instances.

Creating `Connection` instances is performed on the server-side by link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ConnectionFactory.html[`ConnectionFactory`]s and on the client-side by link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/ClientConnectionFactory.html[`ClientConnectionFactory`]s.

On the server-side, the component that aggregates a `SelectorManager` with a set of ``ConnectionFactory``s is link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ServerConnector.html[`ServerConnector`] for TCP sockets, link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/quic/server/QuicServerConnector.html[`QuicServerConnector`] for QUIC sockets, and link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/unixdomain/server/UnixDomainServerConnector.html[`UnixDomainServerConnector`] for Unix-Domain sockets (see the xref:server/io-arch.adoc[server-side architecture section] for more information).

On the client-side, the components that aggregates a `SelectorManager` with a set of ``ClientConnectionFactory``s are link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/client/HttpClientTransport.html[`HttpClientTransport`] subclasses (see the xref:client/io-arch.adoc[client-side architecture section] for more information).

[[endpoint]]
== Jetty I/O: `EndPoint`

The Jetty I/O library use Java NIO to handle I/O, so that I/O is non-blocking.

At the Java NIO level, in order to be notified when a `SocketChannel` or `DatagramChannel` has data to be read, the `SelectionKey.OP_READ` flag must be set.

In the Jetty I/O library, you can call `EndPoint.fillInterested(Callback)` to declare interest in the "read" (also called "fill") event, and the `Callback` parameter is the object that is notified when such an event occurs.

At the Java NIO level, a `SocketChannel` or `DatagramChannel` is always writable, unless it becomes congested.
In order to be notified when a channel uncongests and it is therefore writable again, the `SelectionKey.OP_WRITE` flag must be set.

In the Jetty I/O library, you can call `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` to write the ``ByteBuffer``s and the `Callback` parameter is the object that is notified when the whole write is finished (i.e. _all_ ``ByteBuffer``s have been fully written, even if they are delayed by congestion/uncongestion).

The `EndPoint` APIs abstract out the Java NIO details by providing non-blocking APIs based on `Callback` objects for I/O operations.
The `EndPoint` APIs are typically called by `Connection` implementations, see <<connection,this section>>.

[[connection]]
== Jetty I/O: `Connection`

`Connection` is the abstraction that deserializes incoming bytes into objects, for example an HTTP request object or a WebSocket frame object, that can be used by more abstract layers.

`Connection` instances have two lifecycle methods:

* `Connection.onOpen()`, invoked when the `Connection` is associated with the `EndPoint`.
* `Connection.onClose(Throwable)`, invoked when the `Connection` is disassociated from the `EndPoint`, where the `Throwable` parameter indicates whether the disassociation was normal (when the parameter is `null`) or was due to an error (when the parameter is not `null`).

When a `Connection` is first created, it is not registered for any Java NIO event.
It is therefore typical to implement `onOpen()` to call `EndPoint.fillInterested(Callback)` so that the `Connection` declares interest for read events, and it is invoked (via the `Callback`) when the read event happens.

The abstract class `AbstractConnection` partially implements `Connection` and provides simpler APIs.
The example below shows a typical implementation that extends `AbstractConnection`:

----

[[connection-listener]]
=== Jetty I/O: `Connection.Listener`

The Jetty I/O library allows applications to register xref:arch/listener.adoc[event listeners] for the `Connection` events "opened" and "closed" via the interface `Connection.Listener`.

This is useful in many cases, for example:

* Gather statistics about connection lifecycle, such as time of creation and duration.
* Gather statistics about the number of concurrent connections, and take action if a threshold is exceeded.
* Gather statistics about the number of bytes read and written, and the number of "messages" read and written, where "messages" may mean HTTP/1.1 requests or responses, or WebSocket frames, or HTTP/2 frames, etc.
* Gather statistics about the different types of connections being opened (TLS, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket, etc.).
* Etc.

`Connection.Listener` implementations must be added as beans to a server-side `Connector`, or to client-side `HttpClient`, `WebSocketClient`, `HTTP2Client` or `HTTP3Client`.
You can add as beans many `Connection.Listener` objects, each with its own logic, so that you can separate different logics into different `Connection.Listener` implementations.

The Jetty I/O library provides useful `Connection.Listener` implementations that you should evaluate before writing your own:

* link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/ConnectionStatistics.html[`ConnectionStatistics`]
* link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ConnectionLimit.html[`ConnectionLimit`]

Here is a simple example of a `Connection.Listener` used both on the client and on the server:

[[echo]]
== Jetty I/O: TCP Network Echo

With the concepts above it is now possible to write a simple, fully non-blocking, `Connection` implementation that simply echoes the bytes that it reads back to the other peer.

A naive, but wrong, implementation may be the following:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/SelectorManagerDocs.java[tags=echo-wrong]
----

WARNING: The implementation above is wrong and leads to `StackOverflowError`.

The problem with this implementation is that if the writes always complete synchronously (i.e. without being delayed by TCP congestion), you end up with this sequence of calls:

----
Connection.onFillable()
  EndPoint.write()
    Connection.succeeded()
      Connection.onFillable()
        EndPoint.write()
          Connection.succeeded()
          ...
----

which leads to `StackOverflowError`.

This is a typical side effect of asynchronous programming using non-blocking APIs, and happens in the Jetty I/O library as well.

NOTE: The callback is invoked synchronously for efficiency reasons.
Submitting the invocation of the callback to an `Executor` to be invoked in a different thread would cause a context switch and make simple writes extremely inefficient.

This side effect of asynchronous programming leading to `StackOverflowError` is so common that the Jetty libraries have a generic solution for it: a specialized `Callback` implementation named `org.eclipse.jetty.util.IteratingCallback` that turns recursion into iteration, therefore avoiding the `StackOverflowError`.

`IteratingCallback` is a `Callback` implementation that should be passed to non-blocking APIs such as `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` when they are performed in a loop.

`IteratingCallback` works by starting the loop with `IteratingCallback.iterate()`.
In turn, this calls `IteratingCallback.process()`, an abstract method that must be implemented with the code that should be executed for each loop.

Method `process()` must return:

* `Action.SCHEDULED`, to indicate whether the loop has performed a non-blocking, possibly asynchronous, operation
* `Action.IDLE`, to indicate that the loop should temporarily be suspended to be resumed later
* `Action.SUCCEEDED` to indicate that the loop exited successfully

Any exception thrown within `process()` exits the loops with a failure.

Now that you know how `IteratingCallback` works, a correct implementation for the echo `Connection` is the following:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/SelectorManagerDocs.java[tags=echo-correct]
----

When `onFillable()` is called, for example the first time that bytes are available from the network, the iteration is started.
Starting the iteration calls `process()`, where a buffer is allocated and filled with bytes read from the network via `EndPoint.fill(ByteBuffer)`; the buffer is subsequently written back via `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` -- note that the callback passed to `EndPoint.write()` is `this`, i.e. the `IteratingCallback` itself; finally `Action.SCHEDULED` is returned, returning from the `process()` method.

At this point, the call to `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` may have completed synchronously; `IteratingCallback` would know that and call `process()` again; within `process()`, the buffer has already been allocated so it will be reused, saving further allocations; the buffer will be filled and possibly written again; `Action.SCHEDULED` is returned again, returning again from the `process()` method.

At this point, the call to `EndPoint.write(Callback, ByteBuffer...)` may have not completed synchronously, so `IteratingCallback` will not call `process()` again; the processing thread is free to return to the Jetty I/O system where it may be put back into the thread pool.
If this was the only active network connection, the system would now be idle, with no threads blocked, waiting that the `write()` completes. This thread-less wait is one of the most important features that make non-blocking asynchronous servers more scalable: they use less resources.

Eventually, the Jetty I/O system will notify that the `write()` completed; this notifies the `IteratingCallback` that can now resume the loop and call `process()` again.

When `process()` is called, it is possible that zero bytes are read from the network; in this case, you want to deallocate the buffer since the other peer may never send more bytes for the `Connection` to read, or it may send them after a long pause -- in both cases we do not want to retain the memory allocated by the buffer; next, you want to call `fillInterested()` to declare again interest for read events, and return `Action.IDLE` since there is nothing to write back and therefore the loop may be suspended.
When more bytes are again available to be read from the network, `onFillable()` will be called again and that will start the iteration again.

Another possibility is that during `process()` the read returns `-1` indicating that the other peer has closed the connection; this means that there will not be more bytes to read and the loop can be exited, so you return `Action.SUCCEEDED`; `IteratingCallback` will then call `onCompleteSuccess()` where you can close the `EndPoint`.

The last case is that during `process()` an exception is thrown, for example by `EndPoint.fill(ByteBuffer)` or, in more advanced implementations, by code that parses the bytes that have been read and finds them unacceptable; any exception thrown within `process()` will be caught by `IteratingCallback` that will exit the loop with a failure and call `onCompleteFailure(Throwable)` with the exception that has been thrown, where you can close the `EndPoint`, passing the exception that is the reason for closing prematurely the `EndPoint`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Asynchronous programming is hard.

Rely on the Jetty classes to implement `Connection` to avoid mistakes that will be difficult to diagnose and reproduce.

[[content-source]]
== `Content.Source`

The high-level abstraction that Jetty offers to read bytes is `org.eclipse.jetty.io.Content.Source`.

`Content.Source` offers a non-blocking demand/read model where a read returns a `Content.Chunk` (see also <<content-source-chunk,this section>>).

A `Content.Chunk` groups the following information:

* A `ByteBuffer` with the bytes that have been read; it may be empty.
* Whether the read reached end-of-file, via its `last` flag.
* A failure that might have happened during the read, via its `getFailure()` method.

The `Content.Chunk` returned from `Content.Source.read()` can either be a _normal_ chunk (a chunk containing a `ByteBuffer` and a `null` failure), or a _failure_ chunk (a chunk containing an empty `ByteBuffer` and a non-`null` failure).

A failure chunk also indicates (via the `last` flag) whether the failure is a fatal (when `last=true`) or transient (when `last=false`) failure.

A transient failure is a temporary failure that happened during the read, it may be ignored, and it is recoverable: it is possible to call `read()` again and obtain a normal chunk (or a `null` chunk).
Typical cases of transient failures are idle timeout failures, where the read timed out, but the application may decide to insist reading until some other event happens.
The application may convert a transient failure into a fatal failure by calling `Content.Source.fail(Throwable)`.

A `Content.Source` must be fully consumed by reading all its content, or failed by calling `Content.Source.fail(Throwable)` to signal that the reader is not interested in reading anymore, otherwise it may leak underlying resources.

Fully consuming a `Content.Source` means reading from it until it returns a `Content.Chunk` whose `last` flag is `true`.
Reading or demanding from an already fully consumed `Content.Source` is always immediately serviced with the last state of the `Content.Source`: a `Content.Chunk` with the `last` flag set to `true`, either an end-of-file chunk, or a failure chunk.

Once failed, a `Content.Source` is considered fully consumed.
Further attempts to read from a failed `Content.Source` return a failure chunk whose `getFailure()` method returns the exception passed to `Content.Source.fail(Throwable)`.

When reading a normal chunk, its `ByteBuffer` is typically a slice of a different `ByteBuffer` that has been read by a lower layer.
There may be multiple layers between the bottom layer (where the initial read typically happens) and the application layer that calls `Content.Source.read()`.

By slicing the `ByteBuffer` (rather than copying its bytes), there is no copy of the bytes between the layers, which yields greater performance.
However, this comes with the cost that the `ByteBuffer`, and the associated `Content.Chunk`, have an intrinsic lifecycle: the final consumer of a `Content.Chunk` at the application layer must indicate when it has consumed the chunk, so that the bottom layer may reuse/recycle the `ByteBuffer`.

Consuming the chunk means that the bytes in the `ByteBuffer` are read (or ignored), and that the application will not look at or reference that `ByteBuffer` ever again.

`Content.Chunk` offers a retain/release model to deal with the `ByteBuffer` lifecycle, with a simple rule:

IMPORTANT: A `Content.Chunk` returned by a call to `Content.Source.read()` **must** be released, except for ``Content.Chunk``s that are failure chunks.
Failure chunks _may_ be released, but they do not _need_ to be.

The example below is the idiomatic way of reading from a `Content.Source`:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=idiomatic]
----
<1> The `read()` that must be paired with a `release()`.
<2> The `release()` that pairs the `read()`.

Note how the reads happen in a loop, consuming the `Content.Source` as soon as it has content available to be read, and therefore no backpressure is applied to the reads.

IMPORTANT: Calling `Content.Chunk.release()` must be done only after the bytes in the `ByteBuffer` returned by `Content.Chunk.getByteBuffer()` have been consumed.
When the `Content.Chunk` is released, the implementation may reuse the `ByteBuffer` and overwrite the bytes with different bytes; if the application looks at the `ByteBuffer` _after_ having released the `Content.Chunk` is may see other, unrelated, bytes.

An alternative way to read from a `Content.Source`, to use when the chunk is consumed asynchronously, and you don't want to read again until the `Content.Chunk` is consumed, is the following:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=async]
----
<1> The `read()` that must be paired with a `release()`.
<2> The `release()` that pairs the `read()`.

Note how the reads do not happen in a loop, and therefore backpressure is applied to the reads, because there is not a next read until the chunk from the previous read has been consumed (and this may take time).

Since the `Chunk` is consumed asynchronously, you may need to retain it to extend its lifecycle, as explained in <<content-source-chunk,this section>>.

You can use `Content.Source` static methods to conveniently read (in a blocking way or non-blocking way), for example via `static Content.Source.asStringAsync(Content.Source, Charset)`, or via an `InputStream` using `static Content.Source.asInputStream(Content.Source)`.

Refer to the `Content.Source` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/io/Content.Source.html[`javadocs`] for further details.

[[content-source-chunk]]
=== `Content.Chunk`

`Content.Chunk` offers a retain/release API to control the lifecycle of its `ByteBuffer`.

When ``Content.Chunk``s are consumed synchronously, no additional retain/release API call is necessary, for example:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=chunkSync]
----

On the other hand, if the `Content.Chunk` is not consumed immediately, then it must be retained, and you must arrange for the `Content.Chunk` to be released at a later time, thus pairing the retain.
For example, you may accumulate the ``Content.Chunk``s in a `List` to convert them to a `String` when all the ``Content.Chunk``s have been read.

Since reading from a `Content.Source` is asynchronous, the `String` result is produced via a `CompletableFuture`:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=chunkAsync]
----
<1> The `read()` that must be paired with a `release()`.
<2> The `release()` that pairs the `read()`.
<3> The `retain()` that must be paired with a `release()`.
<4> The `release()` that pairs the `retain()`.

Note how method `consume(Content.Chunk)` retains the `Content.Chunk` because it does not consume it, but rather stores it away for later use.
With this additional retain, the retain count is now `2`: one implicitly from the `read()` that returned the `Content.Chunk`, and one explicit in `consume(Content.Chunk)`.

However, just after returning from `consume(Content.Chunk)` the `Content.Chunk` is released (pairing the implicit retain from `read()`), so that the retain count goes to `1`, and an additional release is still necessary.

Method `getResult()` arranges to release all the ``Content.Chunk``s that have been accumulated, pairing the retains done in `consume(Content.Chunk)`, so that the retain count for the ``Content.Chunk``s goes finally to `0`.

[[content-sink]]
== `Content.Sink`

The high-level abstraction that Jetty offers to write bytes is `org.eclipse.jetty.io.Content.Sink`.

The primary method to use is `Content.Sink.write(boolean, ByteBuffer, Callback)`, which performs a non-blocking write of the given `ByteBuffer`, with the indication of whether the write is the last.

The `Callback` parameter is completed, successfully or with a failure, and possibly asynchronously by a different thread, when the write is complete.

Your application can typically perform zero or more non-last writes, and one final last write.

However, because the writes may be asynchronous, you cannot start a next write before the previous write is completed.

This code is wrong:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=sinkWrong]
----

You must initiate a second write only when the first is finished, for example:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=sinkMany]
----

When you need to perform an unknown number of writes, you must use an `IteratingCallback`, explained in <<echo,this section>>, to avoid ``StackOverFlowError``s.

For example, to copy from a `Content.Source` to a `Content.Sink` you should use the convenience method `Content.copy(Content.Source, Content.Sink, Callback)`.
For illustrative purposes, below you can find the implementation of `copy(Content.Source, Content.Sink, Callback)` that uses an `IteratingCallback`:

include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/ContentDocs.java[tags=copy]

Non-blocking writes can be easily turned in blocking writes.
This leads to perhaps code that is simpler to read, but that also comes with a price: greater resource usage that may lead to less scalability and less performance.
