= Jetty JMX Support

The Java Management Extensions (JMX) APIs are standard API for managing and monitoring resources such as applications, devices, services, and the Java Virtual Machine itself.

The JMX API includes remote access, so a remote management console such as https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/[Java Mission Control] can interact with a running application for these purposes.

Jetty architecture is based on xref:arch/bean.adoc[components] organized in a tree. Every time a component is added to or removed from the component tree, an event is emitted, and xref:arch/bean.adoc#listener-container[Container.Listener] implementations can listen to those events and perform additional actions.

`org.eclipse.jetty.jmx.MBeanContainer` listens to those events and registers/unregisters the Jetty components as MBeans into the platform MBeanServer.

The Jetty components are annotated with <<annotation,Jetty JMX annotations>> so that they can provide specific JMX metadata such as attributes and operations that should be exposed via JMX.

Therefore, when a component is added to the component tree, `MBeanContainer` is notified, it creates the MBean from the component POJO and registers it to the `MBeanServer`.
Similarly, when a component is removed from the tree, `MBeanContainer` is notified, and unregisters the MBean from the `MBeanServer`.

The Maven coordinates for the Jetty JMX support are:

== Enabling JMX Support

Enabling JMX support is always recommended because it provides valuable information about the system, both for monitoring purposes and for troubleshooting purposes in case of problems.

To enable JMX support on the server:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=server]
----

Similarly on the client:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=client]
----

[NOTE]
====
The MBeans exported to the platform MBeanServer can only be accessed locally (from the same machine), not from remote machines.

This means that this configuration is enough for development, where you have easy access (with graphical user interface) to the machine where Jetty runs, but it is typically not enough when the machine where Jetty runs is remote, or only accessible via SSH or otherwise without graphical user interface support.
In these cases, you have to enable <<remote,JMX Remote Access>>.

[[remote]]
== Enabling JMX Remote Access

There are two ways of enabling remote connectivity so that JMC can connect to the remote JVM to visualize MBeans.

* Use the `com.sun.management.jmxremote` system property on the command line.
Unfortunately, this solution does not work well with firewalls and is not flexible.
* Use Jetty's `ConnectorServer` class.

`org.eclipse.jetty.jmx.ConnectorServer` will use by default RMI to allow connection from remote clients, and it is a wrapper around the standard JDK class `JMXConnectorServer`, which is the class that provides remote access to JMX clients.

Connecting to the remote JVM is a two step process:

* First, the client will connect to the RMI _registry_ to download the RMI stub for the `JMXConnectorServer`; this RMI stub contains the IP address and port to connect to the RMI server, i.e. the remote `JMXConnectorServer`.
* Second, the client uses the RMI stub to connect to the RMI _server_ (i.e. the remote `JMXConnectorServer`) typically on an address and port that may be different from the RMI registry address and port.

The host and port configuration for the RMI registry and the RMI server is specified by a `JMXServiceURL`.
The string format of an RMI `JMXServiceURL` is:

[,screen]
----
service:jmx:rmi://<rmi_server_host>:<rmi_server_port>/jndi/rmi://<rmi_registry_host>:<rmi_registry_port>/jmxrmi
----

Default values are:

[,screen]
----
rmi_server_host = localhost
rmi_server_port = 1099
rmi_registry_host = localhost
rmi_registry_port = 1099
----

With the default configuration, only clients that are local to the server machine can connect to the RMI registry and RMI server - this is done for security reasons.
With this configuration it would still be possible to access the MBeans from remote using a <<remote-ssh-tunnel,SSH tunnel>>.

By specifying an appropriate `JMXServiceURL`, you can fine tune the network interfaces the RMI registry and the RMI server bind to, and the ports that the RMI registry and the RMI server listen to.
The RMI server and RMI registry hosts and ports can be the same (as in the default configuration) because RMI is able to multiplex traffic arriving to a port to multiple RMI objects.

If you need to allow JMX remote access through a firewall, you must open both the RMI registry and the RMI server ports.

`JMXServiceURL` common examples:

[,screen]
----
service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi:///jmxrmi
  rmi_server_host = local host address
  rmi_server_port = randomly chosen
  rmi_registry_host = local host address
  rmi_registry_port = 1099

service:jmx:rmi://0.0.0.0:1099/jndi/rmi://0.0.0.0:1099/jmxrmi
  rmi_server_host = any address
  rmi_server_port = 1099
  rmi_registry_host = any address
  rmi_registry_port = 1099

service:jmx:rmi://localhost:1100/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi
  rmi_server_host = loopback address
  rmi_server_port = 1100
  rmi_registry_host = loopback address
  rmi_registry_port = 1099
----

[NOTE]
====
When `ConnectorServer` is started, its RMI stub is exported to the RMI registry.
The RMI stub contains the IP address and port to connect to the RMI object, but the IP address is typically the machine host name, not the host specified in the `JMXServiceURL`.

To control the IP address stored in the RMI stub you need to set the system property `java.rmi.server.hostname` with the desired value.
This is especially important when binding the RMI server host to the loopback address for security reasons. See also <<remote-ssh-tunnel,JMX Remote Access via SSH Tunnel.>>

To allow JMX remote access, create and configure a `ConnectorServer`:

[[remote-authorization]]
=== JMX Remote Access Authorization

The standard `JMXConnectorServer` provides several options to authorize access, for example via JAAS or via configuration files.
For a complete guide to controlling authentication and authorization in JMX, see https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/management/[the official JMX documentation].

In the sections below we detail one way to setup JMX authentication and authorization, using configuration files for users, passwords and roles:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=remoteAuthorization]
----

The `users.access` file format is defined in the `$JAVA_HOME/conf/management/jmxremote.access` file.
A simplified version is the following:

.users.access
[,screen]
----
user1 readonly
user2 readwrite
----

The `users.password` file format is defined in the `$JAVA_HOME/conf/management/jmxremote.password.template` file.
A simplified version is the following:

.users.password
[,screen]
----
user1 password1
user2 password2
----

CAUTION: The `users.access` and `users.password` files are not standard `*.properties` files -- the user must be separated from the role or password by a space character.

=== Securing JMX Remote Access with TLS

The JMX communication via RMI happens by default in clear-text.

It is possible to configure the `ConnectorServer` with a `SslContextFactory` so that the JMX communication via RMI is encrypted:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=tlsRemote]
----

It is possible to use the same `SslContextFactory.Server` used to configure the Jetty `ServerConnector` that supports TLS also for the JMX communication via RMI.

The keystore must contain a valid certificate signed by a Certification Authority.

The RMI mechanic is the usual one: the RMI client (typically a monitoring console) will connect first to the RMI registry (using TLS), download the RMI server stub that contains the address and port of the RMI server to connect to, then connect to the RMI server (using TLS).

This also mean that if the RMI registry and the RMI server are on different hosts, the RMI client must have available the cryptographic material to validate both hosts.

Having certificates signed by a Certification Authority simplifies by a lot the configuration needed to get the JMX communication over TLS working properly.

If that is not the case (for example the certificate is self-signed), then you need to specify the required system properties that allow RMI (especially when acting as an RMI client) to retrieve the cryptographic material necessary to establish the TLS connection.

For example, trying to connect using the JDK standard `JMXConnector` with both the RMI server and the RMI registry via TLS to `domain.com` with a self-signed certificate:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=tlsJMXConnector]
----

Similarly, to launch JMC:

[,screen]
----
$ jmc -vmargs -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/trustStore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=secret
----

IMPORTANT: These system properties are required when launching the `ConnectorServer` too, on the server, because it acts as an RMI client with respect to the RMI registry.

[[remote-ssh-tunnel]]
=== JMX Remote Access with Port Forwarding via SSH Tunnel

You can access JMX MBeans on a remote machine when the RMI ports are not open, for example because of firewall policies, but you have SSH access to the machine using local port forwarding via an SSH tunnel.

In this case you want to configure the `ConnectorServer` with a `JMXServiceURL` that binds the RMI server and the RMI registry to the loopback interface only: `service:jmx:rmi://localhost:1099/jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/jmxrmi`.

Then you setup the local port forwarding with the SSH tunnel:

[,screen]
----
$ ssh -L 1099:localhost:1099 <user>@<machine_host>
----

Now you can use JConsole or JMC to connect to `localhost:1099` on your local computer.
The traffic will be forwarded to `machine_host` and when there, SSH will forward the traffic to `localhost:1099`, which is exactly where the `ConnectorServer` listens.

When you configure `ConnectorServer` in this way, you must set the system property `-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost`, on the server.
This is required because when the RMI server is exported, its address and port are stored in the RMI stub. You want the address in the RMI stub to be `localhost` so that when the RMI stub is downloaded to the remote client, the RMI communication will go through the SSH tunnel.

[[annotation]]
== Jetty JMX Annotations

The Jetty JMX support, and in particular `MBeanContainer`, is notified every time a bean is added to the component tree.

The bean is scanned for Jetty JMX annotations to obtain JMX metadata: the JMX attributes and JMX operations.

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=jmxAnnotation]
----

The JMX metadata and the bean are wrapped by an instance of `org.eclipse.jetty.jmx.ObjectMBean` that exposes the JMX metadata and, upon request from JMX consoles, invokes methods on the bean to get/set attribute values and perform operations.

You can provide a custom subclass of `ObjectMBean` to further customize how the bean is exposed to JMX.

The custom `ObjectMBean` subclass must respect the following naming convention: `<package>.jmx.<class>MBean`.
For example, class `com.acme.Foo` may have a custom `ObjectMBean` subclass named `com.acme.**jmx**.Foo**MBean**`.

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=jmxCustomMBean]
----

The custom `ObjectMBean` subclass is also scanned for Jetty JMX annotations and overrides the JMX metadata obtained by scanning the bean class.
This allows to annotate only the custom `ObjectMBean` subclass and keep the bean class free of the Jetty JMX annotations.

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/JMXDocs.java[tags=jmxCustomMBeanOverride]
----

The scan for Jetty JMX annotations is performed on the bean class and all the interfaces implemented by the bean class, then on the super-class and all the interfaces implemented by the super-class and so on until `java.lang.Object` is reached.
For each type -- class or interface, the corresponding `+*.jmx.*MBean+` is looked up and scanned as well with the same algorithm.
For each type, the scan looks for the class-level annotation `@ManagedObject`.
If it is found, the scan looks for method-level `@ManagedAttribute` and `@ManagedOperation` annotations; otherwise it skips the current type and moves to the next type to scan.

=== @ManagedObject

The `@ManagedObject` annotation is used on a class at the top level to indicate that it should be exposed as an MBean.
It has only one attribute to it which is used as the description of the MBean.

=== @ManagedAttribute

The `@ManagedAttribute` annotation is used to indicate that a given method is exposed as a JMX attribute.
This annotation is placed always on the getter method of a given attribute.
Unless the `readonly` attribute is set to `true` in the annotation, a corresponding setter is looked up following normal naming conventions.
For example if this annotation is on a method called `String getFoo()` then a method called `void setFoo(String)` would be looked up, and if found wired as the setter for the JMX attribute.

=== @ManagedOperation

The `@ManagedOperation` annotation is used to indicate that a given method is exposed as a JMX operation.
A JMX operation has an _impact_ that can be `INFO` if the operation returns a value without modifying the object, `ACTION` if the operation does not return a value but modifies the object, and "ACTION_INFO" if the operation both returns a value and modifies the object.
If the _impact_ is not specified, it has the default value of `UNKNOWN`.

=== @Name

The `@Name` annotation is used to assign a name and description to parameters in method signatures so that when rendered by JMX consoles it is clearer what the parameter meaning is.
