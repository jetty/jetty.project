= HTTP/3 Client Library

In the vast majority of cases, client applications should use the generic, high-level, xref:client/http.adoc[HTTP client library] that also provides HTTP/3 support via the pluggable xref:client/http.adoc#transport-http3[HTTP/3 transport] or the xref:client/http.adoc#transport-dynamic[dynamic transport].

The high-level HTTP library supports cookies, authentication, redirection, connection pooling and a number of other features that are absent in the low-level HTTP/3 library.

The HTTP/3 client library has been designed for those applications that need low-level access to HTTP/3 features such as _sessions_, _streams_ and _frames_, and this is quite a rare use case.

See also the correspondent xref:server/http3.adoc[HTTP/3 server library].

[[intro]]
== Introducing HTTP3Client

The Maven artifact coordinates for the HTTP/3 client library are the following:

[,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty.http3</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-http3-client</artifactId>
  <version>{jetty-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

The main class is named `org.eclipse.jetty.http3.client.HTTP3Client`, and must be created, configured and started before use:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http3/HTTP3ClientDocs.java[tags=start]
----

When your application stops, or otherwise does not need `HTTP3Client` anymore, it should stop the `HTTP3Client` instance (or instances) that were started:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http3/HTTP3ClientDocs.java[tags=stop]
----

`HTTP3Client` allows client applications to connect to an HTTP/3 server.
A _session_ represents a single connection to an HTTP/3 server and is defined by class `org.eclipse.jetty.http3.api.Session`.
A _session_ typically has a long life -- once the connection is established, it remains active until it is not used anymore (and therefore it is closed by the idle timeout mechanism), until a fatal error occurs (for example, a network failure), or if one of the peers decides unilaterally to close the connection.

HTTP/3 is a multiplexed protocol because it relies on the multiplexing capabilities of QUIC, the protocol based on UDP that transports HTTP/3 frames.
Thanks to multiplexing, multiple HTTP/3 requests are sent on the same QUIC connection, or _session_.
Each request/response cycle is represented by a _stream_.
Therefore, a single _session_ manages multiple concurrent _streams_.
A _stream_ has typically a very short life compared to the _session_: a _stream_ only exists for the duration of the request/response cycle and then disappears.

[[connect]]
== Connecting to the Server

The first thing an application should do is to connect to the server and obtain a `Session`.
The following example connects to the server:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http3/HTTP3ClientDocs.java[tags=connect]
----

[[configure]]
== Configuring the Session

The `connect(\...)` method takes a `Session.Client.Listener` parameter.
This listener's `onPreface(\...)` method is invoked just before establishing the connection to the server to gather the client configuration to send to the server.
Client applications can override this method to change the default configuration:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http3/HTTP3ClientDocs.java[tags=configure]
----

The `Session.Client.Listener` is notified of session events originated by the server such as receiving a `SETTINGS` frame from the server, or the server closing the connection, or the client timing out the connection due to idleness.
Please refer to the `Session.Client.Listener` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http3/api/Session.Client.Listener.html[javadocs] for the complete list of events.

Once a `Session` has been established, the communication with the server happens by exchanging _frames_.

[[request]]
== Sending a Request

Sending an HTTP request to the server, and receiving a response, creates a _stream_ that encapsulates the exchange of HTTP/3 frames that compose the request and the response.

In order to send an HTTP request to the server, the client must send a `HEADERS` frame.
`HEADERS` frames carry the request method, the request URI and the request headers.
Sending the `HEADERS` frame opens the `Stream`:

[,java,indent=0,subs=attributes+]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http3/HTTP3ClientDocs.java[tags=newStream]
----

Note how `Session.newRequest(\...)` takes a `Stream.Client.Listener` parameter.
This listener is notified of stream events originated by the server such as receiving `HEADERS` or `DATA` frames that are part of the response, discussed in more details in the <<response,section below>>.
Please refer to the `Stream.Client.Listener` link:{javadoc-url}/org/eclipse/jetty/http3/api/Stream.Client.Listener.html[javadocs] for the complete list of events.

HTTP requests may have content, which is sent using the `Stream` APIs:

[,java,indent=0]
----
include::code:example$src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/docs/programming/client/http3/HTTP3ClientDocs.java[tags=newStreamWithData]
----

IMPORTANT: When sending two `DATA` frames consecutively, the second call to `Stream.data(\...)` must be done only when the first is completed, or a `WritePendingException` will be thrown.
Use the `CompletableFuture` APIs to ensure that the second `Stream.data(\...)` call is performed when the first completed successfully.

[[response]]
== Receiving a Response

Response events are delivered to the `Stream.Client.Listener` passed to `Session.newRequest(\...)`.

An HTTP response is typically composed of a `HEADERS` frame containing the HTTP status code and the response headers, and optionally one or more `DATA` frames containing the response content bytes.

The HTTP/3 protocol also supports response trailers (that is, headers that are sent after the response content) that also are sent using a `HEADERS` frame.

A client application can therefore receive the HTTP/3 frames sent by the server by implementing the relevant methods in `Stream.Client.Listener`:

----

// TODO: flow control?
//include::../../http3.adoc[tag=apiFlowControl]

[[reset]]
== Resetting a Request or Response

In HTTP/3, clients and servers have the ability to tell to the other peer that they are not interested anymore in either the request or the response, by resetting the stream.

The `HTTP3Client` APIs allow client applications to send and receive this "reset" event:
