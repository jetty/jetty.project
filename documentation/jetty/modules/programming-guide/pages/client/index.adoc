= Client Libraries

The Eclipse Jetty Project provides client-side libraries that allow you to embed a client in your applications.
A typical example is a client application that needs to contact a third party service via HTTP (for example a REST service).
Another example is a proxy application that receives HTTP requests and forwards them as FCGI requests to a PHP application such as WordPress, or receives HTTP/1.1 requests and converts them to HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.
Yet another example is a client application that needs to receive events from a WebSocket server.

The client libraries are designed to be non-blocking and offer both synchronous and asynchronous APIs and come with many configuration options.

These are the available client libraries:

* xref:client/http.adoc[The High-Level HTTP Client Library] for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and FastCGI
* xref:client/http2.adoc[The Low-Level HTTP/2 Client Library] for low-level HTTP/2
* xref:client/http3.adoc[The Low-Level HTTP/3 Client Library] for low-level HTTP/3
* xref:client/websocket.adoc[The WebSocket client library]

If you are interested in the low-level details of how the Eclipse Jetty client libraries work, or are interested in writing a custom protocol, look at the xref:client/io-arch.adoc[Client I/O Architecture].
