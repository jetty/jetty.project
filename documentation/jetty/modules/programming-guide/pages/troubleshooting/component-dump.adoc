= Jetty Component Dump

Jetty is based on components organized as a tree of Objects (aka beans), with the `Server` or `Client` instance typically at the root of the tree.

As explained in the xref:operations-guide:jmx/index.adoc[JMX section], these components can be exported as JMX MBeans and therefore be accessible from JMX Consoles such as Java Missions Control (JMC).

Being able to take a snapshot of a Jetty component tree while it is running is the most useful information that can be attached when reporting an issue as it can contain both configuration and current state of Jetty.
A dump of the component tree for the Server includes:

* The thread pool configuration and its current state, including how many threads are in use, and their stack trace.
* The Connector configuration (including TLS configuration), state and statistics.
* The I/O configuration and its current state, including the ports Jetty listens to, how many connections are currently open, and he state of each connection, and the state of the request/response handling for each connection.
* The `Handler` structure and its configuration.
* The web applications deployed and their configurations, including the class loader information.

[[dump-start-stop]]
== Dump at Server Start/Stop

The `Server.dump()` operation may also be invoked just after the `Server` starts (to log the state of the freshly started server), and just before the `Server` stops (which may be useful to log the state of server that is not working properly).

You can temporarily enable the Jetty Server Dump at start time by overriding the `jetty.server.dumpAfterStart` property on the command line:

For embedded usage this can be used by calling the setters directly.

Standalone Jetty uses two properties to control this behaviour which are referenced in `jetty.xml` to call these setters.
These properties are `jetty.server.dumpAfterStart` and `jetty.server.dumpBeforeStop`.

These can be temporarily enabled by supplying these properties as command line arguments,
or to make this change persistent across server restarts they can be enabled via the `server.ini` file (see xref:operations-guide:modules/standard.adoc#server-config[Server Configuration]).

[NOTE]
====
The format of the Jetty Server Dump output is subject to change at any time, as Jetty developers modify the Jetty code and decide to include more state, or remove state that is no longer relevant.

The Jetty Server Dump is organized in a tree whose structure is similar to the runtime Jetty component tree.

At the end of the dump output there is a legend that explains the type of tree node: whether it is a node that represent a _managed_ component, or an _array_ node (or a _map_ node) that represent some component state, etc.

== Obtaining Dump via JMX

The Jetty Component Dump can be obtained by invoking, via JMX, the `Server.dump()` operation, as shown below using https://adoptium.net/jmc.html[Java Mission Control (JMC)]:

image::jmc-server-dump.png[]

Find the `Server` MBean in the MBean Tree, under `org.eclipse.jetty.server:type=server,id=0`.
Then click on the "Operations" tab, select the `dump()` operation, and then click the `Execute` button.
In the bottom panel you will see the result of the invocation, that you can copy into a text editor and save to your file system.

[CAUTION]
====
Taking a Jetty Component Dump is a relatively expensive operation, as it dumps the state of all connections (which can be thousands), and the state of all threads.

The result of the invocation may produce a large string, possibly few MiB, that may impact the server memory usage.

Furthermore, dumping the state of the I/O Jetty components takes a little CPU time off the handling of the actual I/O, possibly slowing it down temporarily.

While the slow-down caused by taking the Jetty Component Dump may be noticeable on highly loaded systems, it is typically a very small price to pay to obtain the information about the Jetty state that may be critical to the resolution of an issue.

[[dump-detailed]]
== Detailed ThreadPool Information

By default, the dump of the thread pool will only dump the topmost stack frame of each thread.
It is possible to configure the thread pool to dump the whole stack trace for each thread; while this may be a little more expensive, it provides complete information about the state of each thread, which may be important to diagnose the issue.

See the xref:operations-guide:modules/standard.adoc#threadpool[`threadpool` module] configuration for more information about how to configure the thread pool to dump detailed thread information.

Detailed thread pool information can also be turned on/off on-the-fly via JMX, by finding the `ThreadPool` MBean under `org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread:type=queuedthreadpool,id=0`, then selecting the `detailedDump` attribute and setting it to `true`. You can now perform the `Server.dump()` operation as explained above, and then set `detailedDump` back to `false`.
