Jetty setup to support Decoration of Listeners, Filters and Servlets within a deployed webapp.
This module uses DecoratingListener to register an object set as a context attribute
as a dynamic decorator.
This module sets the "org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.DecoratingListener"
context attribute with the name of the context attribute that will be listened to.
By default the attribute is "org.eclipse.jetty.ee9.webapp.decorator".
