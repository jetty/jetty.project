/**
 * <p>A reference counted resource, for example one that is borrowed from a pool,
 * that may be retained an additional number of times, and released a correspondent
 * number of times, over its lifecycle.</p>
 * <p>The resource is typically implicitly retained when it is first created.
 * It may be retained more times (thus incrementing its reference count) and released
 * (thus decrementing its reference count), until the reference count goes to zero.</p>
 * <h2><a id="idiom">Idiomatic usage</a></h2>
 * <p>The general rules to use {@code Retainable} objects are the following:</p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>If the {@code Retainable} has been obtained by calling a method, and the
 * caller code consumes it, then the caller code must call {@link #release()}.</li>
 * <li>If the {@code Retainable} has been obtained by {@code caller2} by calling a
 * method, and {@code caller2} returns it without consuming it to {@code caller1},
 * then {@code caller2} must not call {@link #release()}, since {@code caller1} will.</li>
 * <li>If the {@code Retainable} has been obtained as a method argument, the
 * receiver code must either:
 * <ol type="A">
 * <li>Consume the {@code Retainable} synchronously within the method, in which case
 * {@link #release()} must not be called.</li>
 * <li>Pass the {@code Retainable} to some other method, in which case {@link #release()}
 * must not be called.</li>
 * <li>Store away the {@code Retainable} for later or asynchronous processing, for
 * example storing it in containers such as {@link java.util.Collection}s, or capturing
 * it in a lambda that is passed to another thread, etc., in which case {@link #retain()}
 * must be called and a mechanism to call {@link #release()} later or asynchronously
 * for this additional {@link #retain()} must be arranged.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </ol>
