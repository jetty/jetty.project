/**
 * This specialized callback implements a pattern that allows
 * a large job to be broken into smaller tasks using iteration
 * rather than recursion.
 * <p>
 * A typical example is the write of a large content to a socket,
 * divided in chunks. Chunk C1 is written by thread T1, which
 * also invokes the callback, which writes chunk C2, which invokes
 * the callback again, which writes chunk C3, and so forth.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The problem with the example is that if the callback thread
 * is the same that performs the I/O operation, then the process
 * is recursive and may result in a stack overflow.
 * To avoid the stack overflow, a thread dispatch must be performed,
 * causing context switching and cache misses, affecting performance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To avoid this issue, this callback uses an AtomicReference to
 * record whether success callback has been called during the processing
 * of a sub task, and if so then the processing iterates rather than
 * recurring.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement method {@link #process()} where the sub
 * task is executed and a suitable {@link IteratingCallback.Action} is
 * returned to this callback to indicate the overall progress of the job.
 * This callback is passed to the asynchronous execution of each sub
 * task and a call the {@link #succeeded()} on this callback represents
 * the completion of the sub task.
 * </p>
