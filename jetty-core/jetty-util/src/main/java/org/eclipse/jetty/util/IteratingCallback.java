/**
 * This specialized callback implements a pattern that allows
 * a large asynchronous task to be broken into smaller
 * asynchronous sub-tasks using iteration rather than recursion.
 * <p>
 * A typical example is the write of a large content to a socket,
 * divided in chunks. Chunk C1 is written by thread T1, which
 * also invokes the callback, which writes chunk C2, which invokes
 * the callback again, which writes chunk C3, and so forth.
 * <p>
 * The problem with the example above is that if the callback thread
 * is the same that performs the I/O operation, then the process
 * is recursive and may result in a stack overflow.
 * To avoid the stack overflow, a thread dispatch must be performed,
 * causing context switching and cache misses, affecting performance.
 * <p>
 * To avoid this issue, this callback atomically records whether
 * the callback for an asynchronous sub-task has been called
 * during the processing of the asynchronous sub-task, and if so
 * then the processing of the large asynchronous task iterates
 * rather than recursing.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement method {@link #process()} where the
 * asynchronous sub-task is initiated and a suitable {@link Action}
 * is returned to this callback to indicate the overall progress of
 * the large asynchronous task.
 * This callback is passed to the asynchronous sub-task, and a call
 * to {@link #succeeded()} on this callback represents the successful
 * completion of the asynchronous sub-task, while a call to
 * {@link #failed(Throwable)} on this callback represents the
 * completion with a failure of the large asynchronous task.
