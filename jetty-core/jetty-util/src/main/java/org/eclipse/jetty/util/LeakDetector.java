/**
 * A facility to detect improper usage of resource pools.
 * <p>
 * Resource pools usually have a method to acquire a pooled resource and a method to released it back to the pool.
 * <p>
 * To detect if client code acquires a resource but never releases it, the resource pool can be modified to use a
 * {@link LeakDetector}. The modified resource pool should call {@link #acquired(Object)} every time the method to
 * acquire a resource is called, and {@link #released(Object)} every time the method to release the resource is called.
 * {@link LeakDetector} keeps track of these resources and invokes method
 * {@link #leaked(org.eclipse.jetty.util.LeakDetector.LeakInfo)} when it detects that a resource has been leaked (that
 * is, acquired but never released).
 * <p>
 * To detect whether client code releases a resource without having acquired it, the resource pool can be modified to
 * check the return value of {@link #released(Object)}: if false, it means that the resource was not acquired.
 * <p>
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
 * <p>
 * This class relies on {@link System#identityHashCode(Object)} to create a unique id for each resource passed to
 * {@link #acquired(Object)} and {@link #released(Object)}. {@link System#identityHashCode(Object)} does not guarantee
 * that it will not generate the same number for different objects, but in practice the chance of collision is rare.
 * <p>
 * {@link LeakDetector} uses {@link PhantomReference}s to detect leaks. {@link PhantomReference}s are enqueued in their
 * {@link ReferenceQueue} <em>after</em> they have been garbage collected (differently from {@link WeakReference}s that
 * are enqueued <em>before</em>). Since the resource is now garbage collected, {@link LeakDetector} checks whether it
 * has been released and if not, it reports a leak. Using {@link PhantomReference}s is better than overriding
 * {@link #finalize()} and works also in those cases where {@link #finalize()} is not overridable.
 *
 * @param <T> the resource type.
