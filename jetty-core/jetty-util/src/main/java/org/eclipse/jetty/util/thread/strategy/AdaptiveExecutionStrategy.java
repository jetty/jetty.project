/**
 * <p>An adaptive execution strategy that uses the {@link Invocable} status
 * of both the task and the current thread to select an optimal strategy
 * that prioritizes executing the task immediately in the current
 * producing thread if it can be done so without thread starvation issues.</p>
 *
 * <p>This strategy selects between the following sub-strategies:</p>
 * <dl>
 *     <dt>ProduceConsume(PC)</dt>
 *     <dd>The producing thread consumes the task by running it directly
 *     and then continues to produce.</dd>
 *     <dt>ProduceInvokeConsume(PIC)</dt>
 *     <dd>The producing thread consumes the task by running it with {@link Invocable#invokeNonBlocking(Runnable)}
 *     and then continues to produce.</dd>
 *     <dt>ProduceExecuteConsume(PEC)</dt>
 *     <dd>The producing thread dispatches the task to a thread pool to be executed
 *     and then continues to produce.</dd>
 *     <dt>ExecuteProduceConsume(EPC)</dt>
 *     <dd>The producing thread consumes dispatches a pending producer to a thread pool,
 *     then consumes the task by running it directly (as in PC mode), then races with
 *     the pending producer thread to take over production.
 *     </dd>
 * </dl>
 * <p>The sub-strategy is selected as follows:</p>
 * <dl>
 *     <dt>PC</dt>
 *     <dd>If the produced task is {@link Invocable.InvocationType#NON_BLOCKING}.</dd>
 *     <dt>EPC</dt>
 *     <dd>If the producing thread is not {@link Invocable.InvocationType#NON_BLOCKING}
 *     and a pending producer thread is available, either because there is already a pending producer
 *     or one is successfully started with {@link TryExecutor#tryExecute(Runnable)}.</dd>
 *     <dt>PIC</dt>
 *     <dd>If the produced task is {@link Invocable.InvocationType#EITHER} and EPC was not selected.</dd>
 *     <dt>PEC</dt>
 *     <dd>Otherwise.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>Because of the preference for {@code PC} mode, on a multicore machine with many
 * many {@link Invocable.InvocationType#NON_BLOCKING} tasks, multiple instances of the strategy may be
 * required to keep all CPUs on the system busy.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since the producing thread may be invoked with {@link Invocable#invokeNonBlocking(Runnable)}
 * this allows {@link AdaptiveExecutionStrategy}s to be efficiently and safely chained: a task
 * produced by one execution strategy may become itself be a producer in a second execution strategy
 * (e.g. an IO selector may use an execution strategy to handle multiple connections and each
 * connection may use a execution strategy to handle multiplexed channels/streams within the connection).</p>
 *
 * <p>A task containing another {@link AdaptiveExecutionStrategy} should identify as
 * {@link Invocable.InvocationType#EITHER} so when there are no pending producers threads available to
 * the first strategy, then it may invoke the second as {@link Invocable.InvocationType#NON_BLOCKING}.
 * This avoids starvation as the production on the second strategy can always be executed,
 * but without the risk that it may block the last available producer for the first strategy.</p>
 *
 * <p>This strategy was previously named EatWhatYouKill (EWYK) because its preference for a
 * producer to directly consume the tasks that it produces is similar to a hunting proverb
 * that says that a hunter should eat (i.e. consume) what they kill (i.e. produced).</p>
