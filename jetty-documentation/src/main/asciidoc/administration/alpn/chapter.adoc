== Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)

The development of new web protocols such as HTTP/2 raised the need of protocol negotiation within a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake.
A protocol negotiation called https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301[ALPN] (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) RFC7301 has been defined to accomplish this.

ALPN has now replaced the older (and now fully deprecated) NPN in the general Web of 2016.

For those browsers that support HTTP/2, they all now support the ALPN negotiation layers for TLS.
Starting with Jetty 9.3.0, only ALPN is supported by Jetty.
