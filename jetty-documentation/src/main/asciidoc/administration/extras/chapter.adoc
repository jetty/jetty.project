== Provided Servlets, Filters, and Handlers

Jetty ships with a bundle of servlets that interact with the key classes. 
Most are in the org.eclipse.jetty.servlets package. 
These servlets and filters are among the principle elements of Jetty as a component-based infrastructure that holds and runs J2EE applications. 
As described, they play a major role in running and maintaining the Jetty server.

Also included are a number of Jetty specific handlers that allow access to internals of jetty that would not normally be exposed and are very useful testing environments and many production scenarios.
