[[http2-introduction]]
=== Introducing HTTP/2

Jetty supports both a client and a server implementation for the HTTP/2 protocol as defined by http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540[RFC 7540].

The requirements for running HTTP/2 are JDK 8 or greater, and typically also ALPN support (see xref:alpn-chapter[]).

A server deployed over TLS (SSL) normally advertises the HTTP/2 protocol via the TLS extension Application Layer Protocol Negotiation link:#alpn[(ALPN)].

[NOTE]
====
To use HTTP/2 in Jetty via a TLS connector you need to add the link:#alpn-starting[ALPN boot jar] in the boot classpath.
This is done automatically when using the Jetty distribution's start.jar link:#startup-modules[module system], but must be configured directly otherwise.

[[http2-security-update]]
==== Jetty HTTP/2 Security Update

In mid-2019, there were a link:#security-reports[number of CVEs] were issued warning against vulnerable HTTP/2 implementations. These CVEs (CVE-2019-9511 thru CVE-2019-9518) generally centered around attackers manipulating and flooding HTTP/2 servers and creating a denial of service (DOS). These vulnerabilities were patched with Jetty 9.4.21.

As a result of these CVEs, Jetty introduced a new, configurable denial of service (DOS) protection feature in Jetty 9.4.22.

Jettyâ€™s HTTP/2 implementation now features a new Rate Control parameter, `jetty.http2.rateControl.maxEventsPerSecond`, that defaults to 50 events per second, per connection for all pings, bad frames, settings frames, priority changes etc.


[[http2-modules]]
==== Jetty HTTP/2 Sub Projects

The Jetty HTTP/2 implementation consists of the following sub-projects (each producing a jar file):

1.  `http2-common`: Contains the HTTP/2 API and a partial implementation shared across other modules.
2.  `http2-hpack`: Contains the HTTP/2 HPACK implementation for HTTP header compression.
3.  `http2-server`: Provides the server-side implementation of HTTP/2.
4.  `http2-client`: Provides the implementation of HTTP/2 client with a low level HTTP/2 API, dealing with HTTP/2 streams, frames, etc.
5.  `http2-http-client-transport`: Provides the implementation of the HTTP/2 transport for `HttpClient` (see xref:http-client[]).
Applications can use the higher level API provided by `HttpClient` to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses, and the HTTP/2 transport will take care of converting them in HTTP/2 format (see also https://webtide.com/http2-support-for-httpclient/[this blog entry]).
