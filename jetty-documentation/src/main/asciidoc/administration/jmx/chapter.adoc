== Java Management Extensions (JMX)


The http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/[Java Management Extensions (JMX) API] is a standard API for managing and monitoring resources such as applications, devices, services, and the Java virtual machine.

Typical uses of the JMX technology include:

* Consulting and changing application configuration
* Accumulating and making available statistics about application behavior
* Notifying of state changes and erroneous conditions

The JMX API includes remote access, so a remote management program can interact with a running application for these purposes.
