== Session Management

Sessions are a concept within the Servlet api which allow requests to store and retrieve information across the time a user spends in an application.
Choosing the correct session manager implementation is an important consideration for every application as each can fit and perform optimally in different situations.
If you need a simple in-memory session manager that can persist to disk then session management using the local file system can be a good place to start.
If you need a session manager that can work in a clustered scenario with multiple instances of Jetty, then the JDBC session manager can be an excellent option.
Jetty also offers more niche session managers that leverage backends such as MongoDB, Inifinispan, or even Google's Cloud Data Store.
