=== Session Architecture

// TODO: Remove in Jetty 9.5/10 - This paragraph is dated and only really useful for upgrading into 9.4 from prior versions.
==== Changes in Session Architecture
The architecture of Session Management Jetty changed significantly in Jetty 9.4.
These changes have resulted in Sessions not only being easier to configure but making them much more pluggable for various technologies.

In previous versions of Jetty, users were required to configure a separate `SessionIdManager` for each kind of session clustering technology being implemented (JDBC, MongoDB..etc.).
In Jetty 9.4, there is now a single `SessionIdManager` implementation which works across all types of session clustering technologies.
Likewise, prior to Jetty 9.4 there were several different instances of the `SessionManager` class.
Instead of a single `SessionManager` though, it has been done away with entirely, with most of it's functionality moved to the `SesssionHandler` class.
Additionally, Jetty 9.4 introduced the concepts of a `SessionCache` and an associated `SessionDataStore` (both explained below).

Finally, Session scavenging has been re-worked.
Where previously each `SessionManager` instance would periodically scan the in-memory (or clustered) sessions for expired sessions, there is now a single generic scavenger thread which instructs the `SessionHandler` to clean up expired sessions.
Session expiration has been changed to use a much more efficient timer-based mechanism that avoids constant iteration over all current sessions in memory by the scavenger.

==== Session Architecture Hierarchy

Each Jetty instance has a singular `SessionIdManager` to handle all session requests, regardless of clustering technology.
For each context on the server there is one (1) `SessionCache` which contains all of the Session objects for the given context.
The benefit of the `SessionCache` is to ensure that simultaneous requests accessing the same Session Id in the same context always operate on the same Session object.
The SessionCache implementation supplied with the Jetty distribution does just that: keeps Session objects in memory so that they can be shared between simultaneous requests.
However, it is possible to provide your own implementation that never shares Session objects should you require it.

Where the `SessionCache` handles Session information, Session data is stored in a `SessionDataStore` that is specific to the clustering technology being implemented.
There is only one (1) `SessionDataStore` per `SessionCache`.

Visually the session architecture can be represented like this:

==== Configuring Sessions in the Jetty Distribution

Configuring session management involves selecting a link:#startup-modules[module] for the desired type of link:#session-configuration-sessioncache[session caching] behavior, and a module for the type of session persistence.

Jetty provides two different session caches: the `DefaultSessionCache` which holds sessions in memory, and the `NullSessionCache` which does not.
There is more information on both of these types of session caching and the circumstances which would lead you to select one or the other in the link:#sessions-details[Session Components] section, and more information on the configuration options of each in link:#session-configuration-sessioncache[the L1 Session Cache] section.

For session persistence, Jetty provides a number of different implementations from which to choose including link:#configuring-sessions-memory[non-persistence], link:#configuring-sessions-file-system[local file storage], clustered technologies such as link:#configuring-sessions-jdbc[JDBC], link:#configuring-sessions-mongo[MongoDB], link:#configuring-sessions-infinispan[Inifinispan], link:#configuring-sessions-gcloud[Google Cloud Datastore], and link:#configuring-sessions-hazelcast[Hazelcast].

Depending on your persistence technology, to enhance performance, you may want to use an L2 cache for session data, in which case Jetty provides the link:#session-configuration-memcachedsessiondatastore[memcached L2 session data cache].
