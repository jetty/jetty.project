=== Automatic Web Application Deployment

The most basic technique for deploying Web Applications is to put a WAR file or Exploded WAR directory into the `${jetty.base}/webapps/` directory and let Jetty's deployment scanner find it and deploy it under a Context path of the same name.

Only Web Applications that follow the Web Application Layout will be detected by Jetty and deployed this way.

The Context Path assigned to this automatic deployment is based the filename (or directory name) of the WAR.
