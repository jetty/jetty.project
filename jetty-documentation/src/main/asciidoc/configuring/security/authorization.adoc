[[configuring-security-authorization]]
=== Authorization

There are two aspects to securing a web application(or context) within
Jetty:

Authentication::
  The web application can be configured with a mechanism to determine
  the identity of the user. See
  link:#configuring-security-authentication[Configurating Security -
  Authentication].
Authorization::
  Once the identify of the user is known (or not known), the web
  application can be configured with security constraints that declare
  what resources that user may access. This is covered in this section.
