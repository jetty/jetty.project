=== Jetty XML

The Jetty XML format is a straightforward mapping of XML elements to Java APIs so that any object can be instantiated and getters, setters, and methods can be called.

The Jetty XML format is very similar to that of frameworks like Spring or Plexus, although it predates all of them and it's typically more powerful as it can invoke any Java API.

The Jetty XML format is used in xref:og-modules[Jetty modules] to create the Jetty server components, as well as in xref:og-deploy[Jetty XML context files] to configure web applications, but it can be used to call any Java API.
