=== Downloading Jetty

==== Downloading the Jetty Distribution

The standalone Jetty distribution is available for download from the Eclipse Foundation:
====
*Jetty*
https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html
====

It is available in both zip and gzip formats; download the one most appropriate for your system.
When you download and unpack the binary, it is extracted into a directory called `jetty-distribution-VERSION.`
Put this directory in a convenient location.
The rest of the instructions in this documentation refer to this location as either `$JETTY_HOME` or as `$(jetty.home).`

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is important that *only* stable releases are used in production environments.
Versions that have been deprecated or are released as Milestones (M) or Release Candidates (RC) are *not* suitable for production as they may contain security flaws or incomplete/non-functioning feature sets.
