=== Community

Developers and users alike are welcome to engage the Jetty community.
We all have day jobs here so don't just ask questions on IRC and frustrated if no one answers right away.
Stick around to hear an answer, one is likely coming at some point!

Much of our conversations about Jetty occur on IRC in one location or another.
Users are always welcome to come join our IRC channels and talk with us, other users, or just lurk.

  We are idle on here.
