"The scientist. He will 
spend thirty years in
building up a mountain 
range of facts with 
the intent to prove a 
certain theory; then 
he is so happy in his 
achievement that as a 
rule he overlooks the 
main chief fact of all
-- that his accumulation 
proves an entirely different 
thing."
  - Mark Twain
