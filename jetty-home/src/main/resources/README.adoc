==== Quick Setup

Jetty is distributed in an artifact that expands in a directory called `$JETTY_HOME`, which should not be modified.

Configuration for Jetty is typically done in a directory called `$JETTY_BASE`.
There may be more than one `$JETTY_BASE` directories with different configurations.

The following commands can be used to set up a `$JETTY_BASE` directory that supports deployment of `+*.war+` files and a clear-text HTTP connector:

----
$ export JETTY_HOME=/path/to/jetty-home
$ mkdir /path/to/jetty-base
$ cd /path/to/jetty-base
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=server,http,deploy
----

The last command creates a `$JETTY_BASE/start.d/` directory and other directories that contain the configuration of the server, including the `$JETTY_BASE/webapps/` directory, in which standard `+*.war+` files can be deployed.

To deploy Jetty's demo web applications, run this command:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar --add-module=demo
----

Now you can start the Jetty server with:

----
$ java -jar $JETTY_HOME/start.jar
----

Point your browser at `+http://localhost:8080+` to see the demo web applications deployed in Jetty.

The Jetty server can be stopped with `ctrl+c` in the terminal window.
