<h1>Welcome to Jetty 7 - REMOTE ACCESS!!</h1>
<p>
This is the Test webapp for the Jetty 7 HTTP Server and Servlet Container.  
For more information about Jetty, please visit our
<a href="http://jetty.eclipse.org">website</a>
or <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Jetty+Wiki">wiki</a>. 
Commercial support for Jetty is available via <a href="http://www.webtide.com">webtide</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a test context that serves several demo filters and servlets.  However, these
test servlets are not safe for deployment on the internet as (by design) they contain 
cross domain scripting vulnerabilities and reveal private information.  This page
is displayed because you have access the context from a non local IP address.
You can disable the remote address checking by editing the web.xml and changing the
"remote" init parameter to true for the TestFilter. Once the webapp has been reconfigured,
you can access the demonstrations <a href="index.html">here</a>, or <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/">here</a>
if you can access the local machine.
</p>
<p>
This webapp is deployed in $JETTY_HOME/webapp/test and configured by $JETTY_HOME/contexts/test.xml
